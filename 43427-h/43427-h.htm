<p><span class="bold">LORD CHAMBERLAIN,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> in England, an important officer of
the king&rsquo;s household, to be distinguished from the lord
great chamberlain (<i>q.v.</i>). He is the second dignitary of
the court, and is always a member of the government of
the day (before 1782 the office carried cabinet rank), a peer
and a privy councillor. He carries a white staff, and wears a
golden or jewelled key, typical of the key of the palace, which
is supposed to be in his charge, as the ensigns of his office. He
is responsible for the necessary arrangements connected with
state ceremonies, such as coronations and royal marriages,
christenings and funerals; he examines the claims of those who
desire to be presented at court; all invitations are sent out in
his name by command of the sovereign, and at drawing-rooms
arid levees he stands next to the sovereign and announces the
persons who are approaching the throne. It is also part of his
duty to conduct the sovereign to and from his carriage.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The
bedchamber, privy chamber and presence chamber, the wardrobe,
the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, the guardroom and the chapels
royal are in the lord chamberlain&rsquo;s department. He is regarded
as chief officer of the royal household, and he has charge of a large
number of appointments, such as those of the royal physicians,
tradesmen and private attendants of the sovereign. All theatres
in the cities of London and Westminster (except patent theatres),
in certain of the London boroughs and in the towns of Windsor
and Brighton, are licensed by him and he is also licenser of plays
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Theatre</a></span>: <i>Law</i>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Revels, Master of the</a></span>). His
salary is £2000 a year.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The vice-chamberlain of the household is the lord chamberlain&rsquo;s
assistant and deputy. He also is one of the ministry, a white-staff
officer and the bearer of a key; and he is generally a peer or the son
of a peer as well as a privy councillor. He receives £700 a year.
Next to the vice-chamberlain comes the groom of the stole, an office
only in use during the reign of a king. He has the charge of the
vestment called the stole worn by the sovereign on state occasions.
In the lord chamberlain&rsquo;s department also are the master, assistant
master, marshal of the ceremonies and deputy-marshal of the
ceremonies, officers whose special function it is to enforce the observance
of the <i>etiquette</i> of the court. The reception of foreign
potentates and ambassadors is under their particular care, and they
assist in the ordering of all entertainments and festivities at the
palace.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The gentleman usher of the black rod&mdash;the black rod which
he carries being the ensign of his office&mdash;is the principal usher of the
court and kingdom. He is one of the original functionaries of the
order of the Garter, and is in constant attendance on the House of
Lords, from whom, either personally or by his deputy, the yeoman
usher of the black rod, it is part of his duty to carry messages and
summonses to the House of Commons. There are six lords and six
grooms &ldquo;in waiting&rdquo; who attend on the sovereign throughout the
year and whose terms of attendance are of a fortnight&rsquo;s or three
weeks&rsquo; duration at a time. Usually &ldquo;extra&rdquo; lords and grooms in
waiting are nominated by the sovereign, who, however, are unpaid
and have no regular duties. Among the serjeants-at-arms there are
two to whom special duties are assigned: the one attending the
speaker in the House of Commons, and the other attending the lord
chancellor in the House of Lords, carrying their maces and executing
their orders.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The comptroller and examiner of accounts, the
paymaster of the household, the licenser of plays, the dean and
subdean of the chapels royal, the clerk and deputy clerks of the
closet, the groom of the robes, the pages of the backstairs, of the
chamber and of the presence, the poet laureate, the royal physicians
and surgeons, chaplains, painters and sculptors, librarians and
musicians, &amp;c., are all under the superintendence of the lord
chamberlain of the household.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>The queen consort&rsquo;s household is also in the department of the
lord chamberlain of the household. It comprises a lord chamberlain,
a vice-chamberlain and treasurer, equerry and the various ladies of
the royal household, a groom and a clerk of the robes. The ladies
of the household are the mistress of the robes, the ladies of the
bedchamber, the bedchamber women and the maids of honour.
The mistress of the robes in some measure occupies the position of
the groom of the stole.<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a> She is the only lady of the court who comes
into office and goes out with the administration. She is always a
duchess, and attends the queen consort at all state ceremonies and
entertainments, but is never in permanent residence at the palace.<a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
The ladies of the bedchamber share the personal attendance on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
the queen consort throughout the year. Of these there are eight,
always peeresses, and each is in waiting for a fortnight or three
weeks at a time. But the women of the bedchamber, of whom there
are also eight, appear only at court ceremonies and entertainments
according to a roster annually issued under the authority of the lord
chamberlain of the queen consort. They are usually the daughters
of peers or the wives of the sons of peers, and formerly, like the
mistress of the robes and the ladies of the bedchamber, habitually
assisted the queen at her daily toilette. But this has long ceased to
be done by any of them. The eight maids of honour have the
same terms of waiting as the ladies of the bedchamber. They are
commonly if not always the daughters or granddaughters of peers,
and when they have no superior title and precedence by birth are
called &ldquo;honourable&rdquo; and placed next after the daughters of barons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD CHIEF JUSTICE,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> in England, the presiding judge of
the king&rsquo;s bench division of the High Court of Justice, and in
the absence of the lord chancellor, president of the High Court.
He traces his descent from the justiciar of the Norman kings.
This officer appears first as the lieutenant or deputy of the king,
exercising all the functions of the regal office in the absence of
the sovereign. &ldquo;In this capacity William Fitz-Osbern, the
steward of Normandy, and Odo of Bayeux, acted during the
Conqueror&rsquo;s visit to the continent in 1067; they were left,
according to William of Poitiers, the former to govern the north
of England, the latter to hold rule in Kent, vice sua; Florence
of Worcester describes them as &ldquo;custodes Angliae,&rdquo; and Ordericus
Vitalis gives to their office the name of &ldquo;praefectura.&rdquo; It would
seem most probable that William Fitz-Osbern at least was
left in his character of steward, and that the Norman seneschalship
was thus the origin of the English justiciarship&rdquo; (Stubbs&rsquo;s
<i>Constitutional History</i>, i. 346). The same authority observes
that William of Warenne and Richard Clare (Bienfaite), who
were left in charge of England in 1074, are named by a writer
in the next generation &ldquo;praecipui Angliae justitiarii&rdquo;; but
he considers the name to have not yet been definitely attached
to any particular office, and that there is no evidence to show that
officers appointed to this trust exercised any functions at all
when the king was at home, or in his absence exercised supreme
judicial authority to the exclusion of other high officers of the
court. The office became permanent in the reign of William
Rufus, and in the hands of Ranulf Flambard it became coextensive
with the supreme powers of government. But it was
not till the reign of Henry II. that the chief officer of the crown
acquired the exclusive right to the title of <i>capitalis</i> or <i>totius
Angliae justitiarius</i>. Stubbs considers that the English form
of the office is to be accounted for by the king&rsquo;s desire to prevent
the administration falling into the hands of an hereditary noble.
The early justiciars were clerics, in whom the possession of power
could not become hereditary. The justiciar continued to be the
chief officer of state, next to the king, until the fall of Hubert
de Burgh (in the reign of King John), described by Stubbs as
the last of the great justiciars. Henceforward, according to
Stubbs, the office may be said to have survived only in the judicial
functions, which were merely part of the official character of the
chief justiciar. He was at the head of the curia regis, which was
separating itself into the three historical courts of common law
about the time when the justiciarship was falling from the supreme
place. The chancellor took the place of the justiciar in council,
the treasurer in the exchequer, while the two offshoots from the
curia regis, the common pleas and the exchequer, received chiefs
of their own. The king&rsquo;s bench represented the original stock of
the curia regis, and its chief justice the great justiciar. The
justiciar may, therefore, be said to have become from a political
a purely judicial officer. A similar development awaited his
successful rival the chancellor. Before the Judicature Act the
king&rsquo;s bench and the common pleas were each presided over by a
lord chief justice, and the lord chief justice of the king&rsquo;s bench
was nominal head of all the three courts, and held the title of
lord chief justice of England. The titles of lord chief justice of
the common pleas and lord chief baron were abolished by the
Judicature Act 1873, and all the common law divisions of the
High Court united into the king&rsquo;s bench division, the president
of which is the lord chief justice of England.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The lord chief justice is, next to the lord chancellor, the highest
judicial dignitary in the kingdom. He is an <i>ex-officio</i> judge of the
court of appeal. He holds office during good behaviour, and can only
be removed by the crown (by whom he is appointed) after a joint
address of both houses of parliament. He is now the only judicial
functionary privileged to wear the collar of SS. There has been much
discussion as to the origin and history of this collar;<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> it was a badge
or insignia attached to certain offices entitling the holders to wear it
only so long as they held those offices. The collar of SS. was worn
by the chiefs of the three courts previous to their amalgamation in
1873, and that now worn by the lord chief justice of England was
provided by Sir A. Cockburn in 1859 and entailed by him on all
holders of the office. The salary is £8000 a year.</p>

<p>In the United States the supreme court consists of a chief justice
and eight associate justices, any six of whom make a quorum. The
salary of the chief justice is $13,000 and that of the associates
$12,500. The chief justice takes rank next after the president, and
he administers the oath on the inauguration of a new president and
vice-president. The principal or presiding judge in most of the state
judicatures also takes the title of chief justice.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD GREAT CHAMBERLAIN,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> in England, a functionary
who must be carefully distinguished from the lord chamberlain;
he is one of the great officers of state, whose office dates from
Norman times; and the only one who still holds it under a
creation of that period. As his name implies, he was specially
connected by his duties with the king&rsquo;s chamber (<i>camera curie</i>);
but this phrase was also used to denote the king&rsquo;s privy purse,
and the chamberlain may be considered as originally the financial
officer of the household. But as he was always a great baron,
deputies performed his financial work, and his functions became,
as they are now, mainly ceremonial, though the emblem of his
office is still a key. The office had been held by Robert Malet,
son of a leading companion of the Conqueror, but he was forfeited
by Henry I., who, in 1133, gave the great chamberlainship to
Aubrey de Vere and his heirs. Aubrey&rsquo;s son was created earl of
Oxford, and the earls held the office, with some intermission,
till 1526, when the then earl left female heirs. His heir-male
succeeded to the earldom, but the crown, as is now established,
denied his right to the office, which was thenceforth held under
grants for life till Queen Mary and Elizabeth admitted in error
the right of the earls on the strength of their own allegation.
So matters continued till 1626, when an earl died and again
left an heir-male and an heir-female. After an historic contest
the office was adjudged to the former, Lord Willoughby d&rsquo;Eresby.
No further question arose till 1779, when his heirs were two sisters.
In 1781 the House of Lords decided that it belonged to them
jointly, and that they could appoint a deputy, which they did.
Under a family arrangement the heirs of the two sisters respectively
appointed deputies in alternate reigns till the death of
Queen Victoria, when Lord Ancaster, the heir of the elder, who
was then in possession, claimed that he, as such, had sole right
to the office. Lord Cholmondeley and Lord Carrington as coheirs
of the younger sister, opposed his claim, and the crown
also claimed for itself on the ground of the action taken by the
king in 1526. After a long and historic contest, the House of
Lords (1902) declined to re-open the question, and merely
re-affirmed the decision of 1781, and the office, therefore, is now
vested jointly in the three peers named and their heirs.</p>

<p>The lord great chamberlain has charge of the palace of
Westminster, especially of the House of Lords, in which he has
an office; and when the sovereign opens parliament in person
he is responsible for the arrangements. At the opening or closing
of the session of parliament by the sovereign in person he disposes
of the sword of state to be carried by any peer he may select,
and walks himself in the procession on the right of the sword of
state, a little before it and next to the sovereign. He issues the
tickets of admission on the same occasions. He assists at the
introduction of all peers into the House of Lords on their creation,
and at the homage of all bishops after their consecration. At
coronations he emerges into special importance; he still asserts
before the court of claims his archaic right to bring the king his
&ldquo;shirt, stockings and drawers&rdquo; and to dress him on coronation
day and to receive his ancient fees, which include the king&rsquo;s
bed and &ldquo;night robe.&rdquo; He also claims in error to serve the king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
with water before and after the banquet, which was the function
of the &ldquo;ewry,&rdquo; a distinct office held by the earls of Oxford.
At the actual coronation ceremony he takes an active part in
investing the king with the royal insignia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR,<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> one of the great officers of state
of the United Kingdom, and in England the highest judicial
functionary. The history of the office and of the growth of
the importance of the lord chancellor will be found under
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chancellor</a></span>. The lord chancellor is in official rank the
highest civil subject in the land outside the royal family,
and takes precedence immediately after the archbishop of
Canterbury. His functions have sometimes been exercised by
a lord keeper of the great seal (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lord Keeper</a></span>), the only real
difference between the two offices being in the appointment of
the keeper by mere delivery of the seal, while a lord chancellor
receives letters patent along with it. He is by office a privy
councillor, and it has long been the practice to make him a peer
and also a cabinet minister. He is by prescription Speaker
or prolocutor of the House of Lords, and as such he sits upon
the woolsack, which is not strictly within the House. Unlike
the Speaker of the House of Commons, the lord chancellor takes
part in debates, speaking from his place in the House. He votes
from the woolsack instead of going into the division lobby.
The only function which he discharges as Speaker practically
is putting the question; if two debaters rise together, he has
no power to call upon one, nor can he rule upon points of order.
Those taking part in debates address, not the lord chancellor,
but the whole House, as &ldquo;My Lords.&rdquo; The lord chancellor
always belongs to a political party and is affected by its fluctuations.
This has often been denounced as destructive of the
independence and calm deliberativeness essential to the purity
and efficiency of the bench. In defence, however, of the
ministerial connexion of the chancellor, it has been said that,
while the other judges should be permanent, the head of the
law should stand or fall with the ministry, as the best means of
securing his effective responsibility to parliament for the
proper use of his extensive powers. The transference of the
judicial business of the chancery court to the High Court
of Justice removed many of the objections to the fluctuating
character of the office. As a great officer of state, the lord
chancellor acts for both England and Scotland, and in some
respects for the United Kingdom, including Ireland (where,
however, an Irish lord chancellor is at the head of the legal
system). By Article XXIV. of the Act of Union (1705)
one great seal was appointed to be kept for all public acts,
and in this department the lord chancellor&rsquo;s authority extends
to the whole of Britain, and thus the commissions of the
peace for Scotland as well as England issue from him.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> As
an administrative officer, as a judge and as head of the
law, he acts merely for England. His English ministerial
functions are thus briefly described by Blackstone: &ldquo;He became
keeper of the king&rsquo;s conscience, visitor, in right of the
king, of all hospitals and colleges of the king&rsquo;s foundation,
and patron of all the king&rsquo;s livings under the value of twenty
marks per annum in the king&rsquo;s books. He is the general guardian
of all infants, idiots and lunatics, and has the general superintendence
of all charitable uses in the kingdom.&rdquo; But these
duties and jurisdiction by modern statutes have been distributed
for the most part among other offices or committed to the
judges of the High Court (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Charity and Charities</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Infant</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Insanity</a></span>). Under the Judicature Act 1873 the lord chancellor
is a member of the court of appeal, and, when he sits, its president,
and he is also a judge of the High Court of Justice. He is named
as president of the chancery division of the latter court. His
judicial patronage is very extensive, and he is by usage the
adviser of the crown in the appointment of judges<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> of the
High Court. He presides over the hearing of appeals in the
House of Lords. His proper title is &ldquo;Lord High Chancellor
of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo; His salary is £10,000 per annum,
and he is entitled to a pension of £5000 per annum.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD HIGH CONSTABLE,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> in England, the seventh of the
great officers of state. His office is now called out of abeyance
for coronations alone. The constable was originally the commander
of the royal armies and the master of the horse. He
was also, in conjunction with the earl marshal, president of
the court of chivalry or court of honour. In feudal times martial
law was administered in the court of the lord high constable.
The constableship was granted as a grand serjeanty with the
earldom of Hereford by the empress Maud to Milo of Gloucester,
and was carried by his heiress to the Bohuns, earls of Hereford
and Essex. Through a coheiress of the Bohuns it descended to
the Staffords, dukes of Buckingham; and on the attainder
of Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, in the reign of
Henry VIII. it became merged in the crown. The Lacys and
Verduns were hereditary constables of Ireland from the 12th to
the 14th century, and the Hays, earls of Erroll, have been
hereditary constables of Scotland from early in the 14th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD HIGH STEWARD.<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> The Lord High Steward of England,
who must not be confused with the Lord Steward, ranks as the
first of the great officers of state. Appointments to this office
are now made only for special occasions, such as the coronation
of a sovereign or the trial of a peer by his peers. The history
of the office is noteworthy. The household of the Norman and
Angevin kings of England included certain persons of secondary
rank, styled dapifers, seneschals or stewards (the prototypes of
the lord steward), who were entrusted with domestic and state
duties; the former duties were those of purveyors and sewers to
the king, the latter were undefined. At coronations, however,
and great festivals it became the custom in England and elsewhere
to appoint magnates of the first rank to discharge for the
occasion the domestic functions of the ordinary officials. In
accordance with this custom Henry II. appointed both Robert II.,
earl of Leicester, and Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk, to be his
honorary hereditary stewards; and at the Christmas festival
of 1186 the successors in title of these two earls, with William,
earl of Arundel, who held the similar honorary office of hereditary
butler, are described as serving the king at the royal banqueting
table. Subsequently the earls of Leicester bought out the rights
of the earls of Norfolk for ten knights&rsquo; fees.</p>

<p>The last of these earls of Leicester to inherit the hereditary
stewardship was Simon V. de Montfort; how he served as steward
at the coronation of Eleanor, queen of Henry III., is described
in the Exchequer Red Book. The office of steward in France,
then recently suppressed, had for some time been the highest
office of state in that kingdom, and Simon de Montfort appears
to have considered that his hereditary stewardship entitled him
to high official position in England; and after his victory at
Lewes he repeatedly figures as steward of England in official
documents under the great seal. After Simon&rsquo;s death at Evesham
his forfeited estates were conferred on his son Edmund
of Lancaster, who also obtained a grant of the stewardship,
but only for life. Edmund was succeeded by Thomas, earl of
Lancaster, who received a fresh grant of the stewardship to
himself and the heirs of his body from Edward II.; and this
earl it was who, during the weak administration of the last-mentioned
king, first put forward in a celebrated tract the claim
of the steward to be the second personage in the realm and
supreme judge in parliament, a claim which finds some slight
recognition in the preamble to the statute passed against the
Despencers in the first year of Edward III.</p>

<p>Earl Thomas was executed for treason, and though his
attainder was reversed he left no issue, and was succeeded in
the earldom by his brother Henry. The subsequent earls and
dukes of Lancaster were all recognized as stewards of England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
the office apparently being treated as annexed to the earldom, or
honor, of Leicester. John of Gaunt, indeed, at a time when it
was possible that he would never obtain the Leicester moiety of
the Lancastrian estates, seems to have made an ingenious but
quite unfounded claim to the office as annexed to the honor of
Hinckley. Strictly speaking, none of the Lancasters after
Thomas had any clear title either by grant or otherwise; such
title as they had merged in the crown when Henry IV. usurped
the throne. Meanwhile the stewardship had increased in importance.
On the accession of Edward III., Henry, earl of
Lancaster, as president of the council, had superintended the
coronation of the infant king; John of Gaunt did the same
for the infant Richard II.; and, as part of the duties involved,
sat in the White Hall of Westminster to hear and determine the
claims to perform coronation services. The claims were made by
petition, and included amongst others: the claim of Thomas of
Woodstock to act as constable, the rival claims of John Dymock
and Baldwin de Frevile to act as champion, and the claim of
the barons of the Cinque Ports to carry a canopy over the king.
Minutes of these proceedings, in which the duke is stated to
have sat &ldquo;as steward of England,&rdquo; were enrolled by his order.
This is the origin of what is now called the Court of Claims.
The precedent of Richard II. has been followed on all subsequent
occasions, except that in modern times it has been the practice
to appoint commissioners instead of a steward to superintend
this court. In 1397 John of Gaunt created a notable precedent
in support of the steward&rsquo;s claim to be supreme judge in parliament
by presiding at the trial of the earl of Arundel and others.</p>

<p>When Henry IV. came to the throne he appointed his young
son Thomas, afterwards duke of Clarence, to the office of steward.
Clarence held the office until his death. He himself never acted
as judge in parliament; but in 1415 he was appointed to preside
at the judgment of peers delivered in Southampton against
Richard, earl of Cambridge, and Lord Scrope of Masham, who
had been previously tried by commissioners of oyer and terminer.
No permanent steward was ever again created; but a steward
was always appointed for coronations to perform the various
ceremonial services associated with the office, and, until the Court
of Claims was entrusted to commissioners, to preside over that
court. Also, in the 15th century, it gradually became the custom
to appoint a steward <i>pro hac vice</i> to preside at the trial, or at the
proceedings upon the attainder of a peer in parliament; and
later, to preside over a court, called the court of the lord high
steward, for the trial of peers when parliament was not sitting.
To assist in establishing the latter court a precedent of 1400
appears to have been deliberately forged. This precedent is
reported in the printed <i>Year-Book</i> of 1400, first published in
1553; it describes the trial of &ldquo;the earl of H&rdquo; for participation
in the rebellion of that year, and gives details of procedure.
John Holand, earl of Huntingdon, is undoubtedly the earl
indicated, but the evidence is conclusive that he was murdered
in Essex without any trial. The court of the lord high steward
seems to have been first definitely instituted in 1499 for the trial
of Edward Plantagenet, earl of Warwick; only two years earlier
Lord Audley had been condemned by the court of chivalry, a
very different and unpopular tribunal. The Warwick trial was
most carefully schemed: the procedure, fundamentally dissimilar
to that adopted in 1415, follows exactly the forged
precedent; but the constitution of the court was plainly derived
from the Southampton case. The record of the trial was consigned
to a new repository (commonly but wrongly called the
Baga de Secretis), which thenceforth became the regular place
of custody for important state trials. Latterly, and possibly
from its inception, this repository consisted of a closet with
three locks, of which the keys were entrusted, one to the chief
justice of England, another to the attorney-general and the third
to the master of the crown office, or coroner. Notwithstanding
the irregular origin of the steward&rsquo;s court, for which Henry VII.
must be held responsible, the validity of its jurisdiction cannot
be questioned. The Warwick proceedings were confirmed by
act of parliament, and ever since this court has been fully
recognized as part of the English constitution.</p>

<p>For about a century and a half prior to the reign of James I.
the criminal jurisdiction of parliament remained in abeyance,
and bills of attainder were the vogue. The practice of appointing
a steward on these occasions to execute judgment upon a
peer was kept up till 1477, when George, duke of Clarence, was
attainted, and then dropped. Under the Stuarts the criminal
jurisdiction of parliament was again resorted to, and when the
proceedings against a peer were founded on indictment the
appointment of a steward followed as a matter of settled practice.
The proper procedure in cases of impeachment had, on the
contrary, never been defined. On the impeachment of Strafford
the lords themselves appointed Arundel to be high steward.
In Danby&rsquo;s case a commission under the great seal issued in the
common form adopted for the court of the steward; this was
recalled, and the rule agreed to by a joint committee of both
houses that a steward for trials of peers upon impeachments
was unnecessary. But, as such an appointment was obviously
convenient, the lords petitioned for a steward; and a fresh
commission was accordingly issued in an amended form, which
recited the petition, and omitted words implying that the appointment
was necessary. This precedent has been treated as settling
the practice of parliament with regard to impeachments.</p>

<p>Of the proceedings against peers founded upon indictment
very few trials antecedent to the revolution took place in parliament.
The preference given to the steward&rsquo;s court was largely
due to the practice, founded upon the Southampton case, of
summoning only a few peers selected by the steward, a practice
which made it easy for the king to secure a conviction. This
arrangement has been partially abrogated by the Treason Act
of William III., which in cases of treason and misprision of
treason requires that all peers of parliament shall be summoned
twenty days at least before every such trial. The steward&rsquo;s
court also differed in certain other particulars from the high
court of parliament. For example, it was ruled by Lord Chancellor
Jeffreys, as steward at the trial of Lord Delamere, that,
in trials of peers which take place during the recess of parliament
in the steward&rsquo;s court, the steward is the judge of the court,
the court is held before him, his warrant convenes the prisoner
to the bar, his summons convenes the peers for the trial, and he
is to determine by his sole authority all questions of law that arise
in the course of the trial, but that he is to give no vote upon the
issue of guilty or not guilty; during a session of parliament, on
the contrary, all the peers are both triers and judges, and the
steward is only as chairman of the court and gives his vote
together with the other lords. Lord Delamere was tried in 1685
in the steward&rsquo;s court; since then all trials of peers have taken
place before the lords in parliament. The most recent trial was
that of Earl Russell in 1901, when Lord Chancellor Halsbury
was made lord high steward. The steward is addressed as &ldquo;his
grace,&rdquo; he has a rod of office, and the commission appointing
him is dissolved according to custom by breaking this rod.</p>

<p>A court of claims sat and a steward was appointed for the
coronation of Edward VII.; and during the procession in Westminster
Abbey the duke of Marlborough, as steward, carried
&ldquo;St Edward&rsquo;s crown&rdquo; in front of the bearer of the Bible (the
bishop of London), who immediately preceded the king; this
function of the steward is of modern origin. The steward&rsquo;s
ancient and particular services at coronations are practically
obsolete; the full ceremonies, procession from Westminster
Hall and banquet in which he figured prominently, were abandoned
on the accession of William IV.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD HIGH TREASURER,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> in England, once the third great
officer of state. The office was of Norman origin and dated
from 1216. The duty of the treasurer originally was to act as
keeper of the royal treasure at Winchester, while as officer of
the exchequer he sat at Westminster to receive the accounts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
of the sheriffs, and appoint officers to collect the revenue. The
treasurer was subordinate to both the justiciar and the chancellor,
but the removal of the chancery from the exchequer in the
reign of Richard I., and the abolition of the office of justiciars
in the reign of Henry III., increased his importance. Indeed,
from the middle of the reign of Henry III. he became one of
the chief officers of the crown. He took an important part
in the equitable jurisdiction of the exchequer, and was now
styled not merely king&rsquo;s treasurer or treasurer of the exchequer,
but lord high treasurer and treasurer of the exchequer. The
first office was conferred by delivery of a white staff, the second
by patent. Near the end of the 16th century he had developed
into an official so occupied with the general policy of the country
as to be prevented from supervising personally the details of
the department, and Lord Burleigh employed a secretary for
this purpose. On the death of Lord Salisbury in 1612 the office
was put in commission; it was filled from time to time until
1714, when the duke of Shrewsbury resigned it; since that time
it has always been in commission (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Treasury</a></span>). The Scottish
treasury was merged with the English by the Act of Union,
but the office of lord high treasurer for Ireland was continued
until 1816.</p>

name is commemorated in the adjacent islet of Ball&rsquo;s Pyramid),
and is a dependency of New South Wales. It measures about
5½ m. by 1 m., and is well wooded and hilly (reaching a height
of 2840 ft. at the southern end), being of volcanic formation,
while there are coral reefs on the western shore. It has a pleasant
climate. The name Lord Howe is given also to an islet of the
Santa Cruz group, and to two islands, also known under other
names&mdash;Mopiha, of the Society group, and Ongtong Java of

to the lord justice-general. He presides in the second division
of the court of session, and in the absence of the lord justice-general,
presides in the court of justiciary. The justice clerk
was originally not a judge at all, but simply clerk and legal
assessor of the justice court. In course of time he was raised
from the clerk&rsquo;s table to the bench, and by custom presided
over the court in the absence of the justice-general. Up to
1672 his position was somewhat anomalous, as it was doubtful
whether he was a clerk or a judge, but an act of that year, which
suppressed the office of justice-depute, confirmed his position
as a judge, forming him, with the justice-general and five of
the lords of session into the court of justiciary. The lord justice
clerk is also one of the officers of state for Scotland, and one of
the commissioners for keeping the Scottish Regalia. His salary
is £4800 a year.</p>

time a sinecure post held by one of the Scottish nobility,
but by the Court of Session Act 1830, it was enacted that, at
the termination of the existing interest, the office should be united
with that of lord president of the court of session, who then
became presiding judge of the court of justiciary. The salary
is £5000 a year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD KEEPER OF THE GREAT SEAL,<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> in England, formerly
a great officer of state. The Great Seal of England, which is
affixed on all solemn occasions to documents expressing the
pleasure of the sovereign, was first adopted by Edward the
Confessor (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seals</a></span>), and entrusted to a chancellor for keeping.
The office of chancellor from the time of Becket onwards varied
much in importance; the holder being an ecclesiastic, he was
not only engaged in the business of his diocese, but sometimes
was away from England. Consequently, it became not unusual
to place the personal custody of the great seal in the hands of
a vice-chancellor or keeper; this, too, was the practice followed
during a temporary vacancy in the chancellorship. This office
gradually developed into a permanent appointment, and the
lord keeper acquired the right of discharging all the duties
connected with the great seal. He was usually, though not
necessarily, a peer, and held office during the king&rsquo;s pleasure,
he was appointed merely by delivery of the seal, and not, like
the chancellor, by patent. His status was definitely fixed (in the
case of lord keeper Sir Nicholas Bacon) by an act of Elizabeth,
which declared him entitled to &ldquo;like place, pre-eminence,
jurisdiction, execution of laws, and all other customs, commodities,
and advantages&rdquo; as the lord chancellor. In subsequent
reigns the lord keeper was generally raised to the
chancellorship, and retained the custody of the seal. The last
lord keeper was Sir Robert Henley (afterwards Lord Northington),
who was made chancellor on the accession of George III.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD MAYOR&rsquo;S DAY,<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> in England, the 9th of November,
the date of the inauguration of the lord mayor of London
(see Vol. XVI., p. 966), marked by a pageant known as the
Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show. The first of these pageants was held in
1215. The idea originated in the stipulation made in a charter
then granted by John that the citizen chosen to be mayor
should be presented to the king or his justice for approval.
The crowd of citizens who accompanied the mayor on horseback
to Westminster developed into a yearly pageant, which
each season became more elaborate. Until the 15th century
the mayor either rode or walked to Westminster, but in 1453
Sir John Norman appears to have set a fashion of going
by water. From 1639 to 1655 the show disappeared owing to
Puritan opposition. With the Restoration the city pageant
was revived, but interregnums occurred during the years of
the plague and fire, and in 1683 when a quarrel broke out
between Charles and the city, ending in the temporary abrogation
of the charter. In 1711 an untoward accident befell
the show, the mayor Sir Gilbert Heathcote (the original of
Addison&rsquo;s Sir Andrew Freeport) being thrown by his horse.
The next year a coach was, in consequence, provided for the
chief magistrate. In 1757 this was superseded by a gilded and
elaborately decorated equipage costing £10,065 which was used
till 1896, when a replica of it was built to replace it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL,<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> in England, one of the
great officers of state, and a member of the ministry. It was
only in 1679 that the office of lord president became permanent.
Previously either the lord chancellor, the lord keeper of the
seal, or some particular court official took formal direction of
the Privy Council. In the reign of Charles I. a special lord
president of the council was appointed, but in the following
reign the office was left unfilled. The office was of considerable
importance when the powers of the Privy Council, exercised
through various committees, were of greater extent than at the
present time. For example, a committee of the lords of the
council was formerly responsible for the work now dealt with by
the secretary of state for foreign affairs; so also with that now
discharged by the Board of Trade. The lord president up to
1855&mdash;when a new post of vice-president of the council was
created&mdash;was responsible for the education department. He
was also responsible for the duties of the council in regard to
public health, now transferred to the Local Government Board,
and for duties in regard to agriculture, now transferred to the
Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. The duties of the office now
consist of presiding on the not very frequent occasions when the
Privy Council meets, and of the drawing up of minutes of council
upon subjects which do not belong to any other department of
state. The office is very frequently held in conjunction with
other ministerial offices, for example, in Gladstone&rsquo;s fourth
ministry the secretary of state for India was also lord president
of the council, and in the conservative ministry of 1903 the
holder of the office was also president of the Board of Education.
The lord president is appointed by a declaration made in council
by the sovereign. He is invariably a member of the House of
Lords, and he is also included in the cabinet.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
Court of Judicature Act 1877. The number was fixed at five
by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1881, s. 3. Their

members of the House of Lords to adjudicate in cases before
that House in its legal capacity, and also to aid the judicial
committee of the Privy Council in hearing appeals. Of the four
lords of appeal in ordinary one is usually appointed from the
Irish bench or bar and one from Scotland. Their salary is
£6000 a year. They hold office on the same conditions as other
judges. By the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, under which they
are appointed, lords of appeal in ordinary are, by virtue of and
according to the date of their appointment, entitled during
life to rank as barons and during the time that they continue in
office are entitled to a writ of summons to attend, and to sit and
vote in the House of Lords. They are life peers only. The
patent of a lord of appeal in ordinary differs from that of a baron
in that he is not &ldquo;created&rdquo; but &ldquo;nominated and appointed
to be a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary by the style of Baron.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD STEWARD,<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> in England, an important official of the
king&rsquo;s household. He is always a member of the government,
a peer and a privy councillor. Up to 1782, the office was one of
considerable political importance and carried cabinet rank.
The lord steward receives his appointment from the sovereign
in person, and bears a white staff as the emblem and warrant of
his authority. He is the first dignitary of the court. In the
<i>Statutes of Eltham</i> he is called &ldquo;the lord great master,&rdquo; but in
the <i>Household Book</i> of Queen Elizabeth &ldquo;the lord steward,&rdquo;
as before and since. In an act of Henry VIII. (1539) &ldquo;for
placing of the lords,&rdquo; he is described as &ldquo;the grand master or
lord steward of the king&rsquo;s most honourable household.&rdquo; He
presides at the Board of Green Cloth.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In his department are
the treasurer and comptroller of the household, who rank next
to him. These officials are usually peers or the sons of peers and
privy councillors. They sit at the Board of Green Cloth, carry
white staves, and belong to the ministry. But the duties which
in theory belong to the lord steward, treasurer and comptroller
of the household are in practice performed by the master of the
household, who is a permanent officer and resides in the palace.
He is a white-staff officer and a member of the Board of Green
Cloth but not of the ministry, and among other things he presides
at the daily dinners of the suite in waiting on the sovereign.
In his case history repeats itself. He is not named in the <i>Black
Book</i> of Edward IV. or in the <i>Statutes</i> of Henry VIII., and
is entered as &ldquo;master of the household and clerk of the green
cloth&rdquo; in the <i>Household Book</i> of Queen Elizabeth. But he has
superseded the lord steward of the household, as the lord steward
of the household at one time superseded the lord high steward
of England.</p>

<p>In the lord steward&rsquo;s department are the officials of the Board
of Green Cloth, the coroner (&ldquo;coroner of the verge&rdquo;), and paymaster
of the household, and the officers of the almonry (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Almoner</a></span>). Other offices in the department were those of the
cofferer of the household, the treasurer of the chamber, and the
paymaster of pensions, but these, with six clerks of the Board of
Green Cloth, were abolished in 1782. The lord steward had
formerly three courts besides the Board of Green Cloth under
him. First, the lord steward&rsquo;s court, superseded (1541) by&mdash;second&mdash;the
Marshalsea court, a court of record having jurisdiction,
both civil and criminal within the verge (the area within a
radius of 12 m. from where the sovereign is resident), and
originally held for the purpose of administering justice between
the domestic servants of the sovereign, &ldquo;that they might not
be drawn into other courts and their service lost.&rdquo; Its criminal
jurisdiction had long fallen into disuse and its civil jurisdiction
was abolished in 1849. Third, the palace court, created by letters
patent in 1612 and renewed in 1665 with jurisdiction over all
personal matters arising between parties within 12 m. of Whitehall
(the jurisdiction of the Marshalsea court, the City of London,
and Westminster Hall being excepted). It differed from the
Marshalsea court in that it had no jurisdiction over the sovereign&rsquo;s
household nor were its suitors necessarily of the household.
The privilege of practising before the palace court was limited
to four counsel. It was abolished in 1849. The lord steward or
his deputies formerly administered the oaths to the members
of the House of Commons. In certain cases (messages from the
sovereign under the sign-manual) &ldquo;the lords with white staves&rdquo;
are the proper persons to bear communications between the
sovereign and the houses of parliament.</p>

of Saint Céneri as a base of operations during the next few years,
he seized upon Matthew Gough near Vivoin in 1431, and made an
incursion as far as the walls of Caen, whence he brought away
three thousand prisoners. Taken captive himself in 1433, he
was exchanged for Talbot. In 1435 he and Dunois defeated
the English near Meulan, and in 1436 he helped the constable
Arthur, earl of Richmond (de Richmond), to expel them from
Paris. He was appointed provost of Paris in February 1437,
and in 1438 he was made &ldquo;judge and general reformer of the
malefactors of the kingdom.&rdquo; He was present in 1439 at the
taking of Meaux, in 1441 at that of Pontoise, and he died on the

<i>lár</i>, as the Dutch <i>leer</i> and Ger. <i>Lehre</i>, represents the Old Teutonic
root, meaning to impart or receive knowledge, seen in &ldquo;to
learn,&rdquo; &ldquo;learning.&rdquo; In the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for June
1830 it was suggested that &ldquo;lore&rdquo; should be used as a termination
instead of the Greek derivative -<i>ology</i> in the names of the various
sciences. This was never done, but the word, both as termination
and alone, is frequently applied to the many traditional beliefs,
stories, &amp;c., connected with the body of knowledge concerning
some special subject; <i>e.g.</i> legendary lore, bird-lore, &amp;c. The
most familiar use is in &ldquo;folk-lore&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORELEI<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (from Old High Ger. <i>Lur</i>, connected with modern
Ger. <i>lauern</i>, &ldquo;to lurk,&rdquo; &ldquo;be on the watch for,&rdquo; and equivalent
to elf, and <i>lai</i>, &ldquo;a rock&rdquo;). The Lorelei is a rock in the Rhine
near St Goar, which gives a remarkable echo, which may partly
account for the legend. The tale appears in many forms, but is
best known through Heinrich Heine&rsquo;s poem, beginning <i>Ich
weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten</i>. In the commonest form of the
story the Lorelei is a maiden who threw herself into the Rhine
in despair over a faithless lover, and became a siren whose voice
lured fishermen to destruction. The 13th-century minnesinger,
known as Der Marner, says that the Nibelungen treasure was
hidden beneath the rock. The tale is obviously closely connected
with the myth of Holda, queen of the elves. On the Main
she sits combing her locks on the Hullenstein, and the man
who sees her loses sight or reason, while he who listens is condemned
to wander with her for ever. The legend, which Clemens
Brentano claimed as his own invention when he wrote his poem
&ldquo;Zu Bacharach am Rheine&rdquo; in his novel of <i>Godwi</i> (1802), bears
all the marks of popular mythology. In the 19th century it
formed material for a great number of songs, dramatic sketches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>
operas and even tragedies, which are enumerated by Dr Hermann
Seeliger in his <i>Loreleysage in Dichtung und Musik</i> (Leipzig-Reudnitz,
1898). The favourite poem with composers was
Heine&rsquo;s, set to music by some twenty-five musicians, the settings
by Friedrich Silcher (from an old folk-song) and by Liszt being
the most famous.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORETO,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> an episcopal see and pilgrimage resort of the Marches,
Italy, in the province of Ancona, 15 m. by rail S.S.E. of that
town. Pop. (1901) 1178 (town), 8033 (commune). It lies
upon the right bank of the Musone, at some distance from the
railway station, on a hill-side commanding splendid views from
the Apennines to the Adriatic, 341 ft. above sea-level. The town
itself consists of little more than one long narrow street, lined
with shops for the sale of rosaries, medals, crucifixes and similar
objects, the manufacture of which is the sole industry of the place.
The number of pilgrims is said to amount to 50,000 annually,
the chief festival being held on the 8th of September, the
Nativity of the Virgin. The principal buildings, occupying the
four sides of the piazza, are the college of the Jesuits, the Palazzo
Apostolico, now Reale (designed by Bramante), which contains
a picture gallery with works of Lorenzo Lotto, Vouet and
Caracci and a collection of majolica, and the cathedral church
of the Holy House (Chiesa della Casa Santa), a Late Gothic
structure continued by Giuliano da Maiano, Giuliano da Sangallo
and Bramante. The handsome façade of the church was erected
under Sixtus V., who fortified Loreto and gave it the privileges
of a town (1586); his colossal statue stands in the middle of the
flight of steps in front. Over the principal doorway is a life-size
bronze statue of the Virgin and Child by Girolamo Lombardo;
the three superb bronze doors executed at the latter end of the
16th century and under Paul V. (1605-1621) are also by Lombardo,
his sons and his pupils, among them Tiburzio Vergelli,
who also made the fine bronze font in the interior. The doors
and hanging lamps of the Santa Casa are by the same artists.
The richly decorated campanile, by Vanvitelli, is of great height;
the principal bell, presented by Leo X. in 1516, weighs 11 tons.
The interior of the church has mosaics by Domenichino and Guido
Reni and other works of art. In the sacristies on each side of
the right transept are frescoes, on the right by Melozzo da Forli,
on the left by Luca Signorelli. In both are fine intarsias.</p>

<p>But the chief object of interest is the Holy House itself. It
is a plain stone building, 28 ft. by 12½ and 13½ ft. in height;
it has a door on the north side and a window on the west;
and a niche contains a small black image of the Virgin and Child,
in Lebanon cedar, and richly adorned with jewels. St Luke is
alleged to have been the sculptor; its workmanship suggests
the latter half of the 15th century. Around the Santa Casa is a
lofty marble screen, designed by Bramante, and executed under
Popes Leo X., Clement VII. and Paul III., by Andrea Sansovino,
Girolamo Lombardo, Bandinelli, Guglielmo della Porta and
others. The four sides represent the Annunciation, the Nativity,
the Arrival of the Santa Casa at Loreto and the Nativity of the
Virgin respectively. The treasury contains a large variety of
rich and curious votive offerings. The architectural design is
finer than the details of the sculpture. The choir apse is decorated
with modern German frescoes, which are somewhat out of place.</p>

<p>The legend of the Holy House seems to have sprung up (how
is not exactly known) at the close of the crusading period.</p>

<p>It is briefly referred to in the <i>Italia Illustrata</i> of Flavius
Blondus, secretary to Popes Eugenius IV., Nicholas V.,
Calixtus III. and Pius II. (<i>ob.</i> 1464); it is to be read in all its
fullness in the &ldquo;Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesiae Lauretana
historia,&rdquo; by a certain Teremannus, contained in the <i>Opera Omnia</i>
(1576) of Baptista Mantuanus. According to this narrative the
house at Nazareth in which Mary had been born and brought up,
had received the annunciation, and had lived during the childhood
of Jesus and after His ascension, was converted into a church
by the apostles. In 336 the empress Helena made a pilgrimage
to Nazareth and caused a basilica to be erected over it, in which
worship continued until the fall of the kingdom of Jerusalem.
Threatened with destruction by the Turks, it was carried by
angels through the air and deposited (1291) in the first instance
on a hill at Tersatto in Dalmatia, where an appearance of the
Virgin and numerous miraculous cures attested its sanctity,
which was confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by
messengers from the governor of Dalmatia. In 1294 the angels
carried it across the Adriatic to a wood near Recanati; from this
wood (lauretum), or from the name of its proprietrix (Laureta),
the chapel derived the name which it still retains (&ldquo;sacellum
gloriosae Virginis in Laureto&rdquo;). From this spot it was afterwards
(1295) removed to the present hill, one other slight
adjustment being required to fix it in its actual site. Bulls in
favour of the shrine at Loreto were issued by Pope Sixtus IV.
in 1491 and by Julius II. in 1507, the last alluding to the translation
of the house with some caution (&ldquo;ut pie creditur et fama
est&rdquo;). The recognition of the sanctuary by subsequent pontiffs
has already been alluded to. In the end of the 17th century
Innocent XII. appointed a &ldquo;missa cum officio proprio&rdquo; for the
feast of the Translation of the Holy House, and the feast is
still enjoined in the Spanish Breviary as a &ldquo;greater double&rdquo;
(December 10).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORETO,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> an inland department of Peru, lying E. of the
Andean Cordilleras and forming the N.E. part of the republic.
Extensive territories, nominally parts of this department, are in
dispute between Peru and the neighbouring republics of Brazil,
Colombia and Ecuador (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peru</a></span>), and the northern and eastern
boundaries of the territory are therefore not definitely determined.
Loreto is bounded W. by the departments of Amazonas and San
Martin (the latter a new department, with an area of 30,744 sq. m.,
taken from Loreto, lying between the central and eastern
Cordilleras and extending from the 6th to the 9th parallels,
approximately), and S. by Huánuco and Cuzco. The area of the
department, including the territories claimed by Peru, is estimated
at 257,798 sq. m. The population is estimated (1906) at 120,000.
The aboriginal population is not numerous, as the thick, humid
forests are inhabited only where lakes and streams make open
spaces for sunlight and ventilation. With the exception of the
eastern Andean slopes and a little-known range of low mountains
on the Brazilian frontier, called the Andes Conomamas, the surface
is that of a thickly wooded plain sloping gently towards the
Marañon, or Upper Amazon, which crosses it from W. to E.
There are open plains between the Ucayali and Huallaga, known
as the Pampas del Sacramento, but otherwise there are no
extensive breaks in the forest. The elevation of the plain near
the base of the Andes is 526 ft. on the Ucayali, 558 on the
Huallaga, and 453 at Barranca, on the Marañon, a few miles
below the Pongo de Manseriche. The eastward slope of the
plain is about 250 ft. in the 620 m. (direct) between this point
and Tabatinga, on the Brazilian frontier; this not only shows
the remarkably level character of the Amazon valley of which it
forms a part, but also the sluggish character of its drainage.
From the S. the principal rivers traversing Loreto are the Ucayali
and Huallaga, the former entering from Cuzco across its southern
boundary and skirting the eastern base of the Andes for about
four degrees of latitude before it turns away to the N.E. to join the
Marañon, and the latter breaking through the Eastern Cordillera
between the 6th and 7th parallels and entering the Marañon
143 m. below Yurimaguas, where navigation begins. The lower
Ucayali, which has a very tortuous course, is said to have 868 m.
of navigable channel at high water and 620 m. at low water.
North of the Marañon several large rivers pass through Peruvian
territory between the Santiago and Napo (see Ecuador), nearly
all having navigable channels. On the level plains are a number
of lakes, some are formed by the annual floods and are temporary
in character. Among the permanent lakes are the Gran Cocama,
of the Pampas del Sacramento, the Caballococha&mdash;a widening
of the Amazon itself about 60 m. N.W. of Tabatinga&mdash;and
Rimachuma, on the north side of the Marañon, near the lower
Pastaza.</p>

<p>The natural resources of this extensive region are incalculable,
but their development has been well nigh impossible through
lack of transport facilities. They include the characteristic
woods of the Amazon valley, rubber, nuts, cinchona or Peruvian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
bark, medicinal products, fish, fruits and fibres. The cultivated
products include cocoa, coffee, tobacco and fruits. Straw hats and
hammocks are manufactured to some extent. The natural outlet
of this region is the Amazon river, but this involves 2500 m. of
river navigation from Iquitos before the ocean is reached.
Communication with the Pacific coast cities and ports of Peru
implies the crossing of three high, snow-covered ranges of the
Andes by extremely difficult trails and passes. A rough mountain
road has been constructed from Oroya to Puerto Bermudez, at
the head of navigation on the Pachitea, and is maintained by the
government pending the construction of a railway, but the
distance is 210 m. and it takes nine days for a mule train to make
the journey. At Puerto Bermudez a river steamer connects with
Iquitos, making the distance of 930 m. in seven days. From
Lima to Iquitos by this route, therefore, involves 17 days travel
over a distance of 1268 m. The most feasible route from the
department to the Pacific coast is that which connects Puerto
Limon, on the Marañon, with the Pacific port of Payta, a distance
of 410 m., it being possible to cross the Andes on this route at the
low elevation of 6600 ft. The climate of Loreto is hot and humid,
except on the higher slopes of the Andes. The year is divided
into a wet and a dry season, the first from May to October, and the
average annual rainfall is estimated at 70 in. though it varies
widely between distant points. The capital and only town of
importance in the department is Iquitos.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORIENT,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> a maritime town of western France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Morbihan, on the right
bank of the Scorff at its confluence with the Blavet, 34 m. W. by
N. of Vannes by rail. Pop. (1906) 40,848. The town is modern
and regularly built. Its chief objects of interest are the church
of St Louis (1709) and a statue by A. Mercié of Victor Massé, the
composer, born at Lorient in 1822. It is one of the five maritime
prefectures in France and the first port for naval construction in
the country. The naval port to the east of the town is formed by
the channel of the Scorff, on the right bank of which the chief
naval establishments are situated. These include magazines,
foundries, forges, fitting-shops, rope-works and other workshops
on the most extensive scale, as well as a graving dock, a covered
slip and other slips. A floating bridge connects the right bank
with the peninsula of Caudan formed by the union of the Scorff
and Blavet. Here are the shipbuilding yards covering some
38 acres, and comprising nine slips for large vessels and two others
for smaller vessels, besides forges and workshops for iron shipbuilding.
The commercial port to the south of the town consists
of an outer tidal port protected by a jetty and of an inner dock,
both lined by fine quays planted with trees. It separates the
older part of the town, which is hemmed in by fortifications from
a newer quarter. In 1905, 121 vessels of 28,785 tons entered
with cargo and 145 vessels of 38,207 tons cleared. The chief
export is pit-timber, the chief import is coal. Fishing is actively
carried on. Lorient is the seat of a sub-prefect, of commercial
and maritime tribunals and of a tribunal of first instance, and has
a chamber of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, a lycée,
schools of navigation, and naval artillery. Private industry is
also engaged in iron-working and engine making. The trade in
fresh fish, sardines, oysters (which are reared near Lorient) and
tinned vegetables is important and the manufacture of basket-work,
tin-boxes and passementerie, arid the preparation of
preserved sardines and vegetables are carried on. The roadstead,
formed by the estuary of the Blavet, is accessible to vessels
of the largest size; the entrance, 3 or 4 m. south from Lorient,
which is defended by numerous forts, is marked on the east by the
peninsula of Gâvres (an artillery practising ground) and the
fortified town of Port Louis; on the west are the fort of Loqueltas
and, higher up, the battery of Kernevel. In the middle of the
channel is the granite rock of St Michel, occupied by a powder
magazine. Opposite it, on the right bank of the Blavet, is the
mouth of the river Ter, with fish and oyster breeding establishments
from which 10 millions of oysters are annually obtained.
The roadstead is provided with six lighthouses. Above Lorient
on the Scorff, here spanned by a suspension bridge, is Kérentrech,
a pretty village surrounded by numerous country houses.</p>

<p>Lorient took the place of Port Louis as the port of the Blavet.
The latter stands on the site of an ancient hamlet which was
fortified during the wars of the League and handed over by
Philip Emmanuel, duke of Morc&oelig;ur, to the Spaniards. After the
treaty of Vervins it was restored to France, and it received its
name of Port Louis under Richelieu. Some Breton merchants
trading with the Indies had established themselves first at Port
Louis, but in 1628 they built their warehouses on the other bank.
The Compagnie des Indes Orientales, created in 1664, took
possession of these, giving them the name of l&rsquo;Orient. In 1745
the Compagnie des Indes, then at the acme of its prosperity,
owned thirty-five ships of the largest class and many others of
considerable size. Its decadence dates from the English conquest
of India, and in 1770 its property was ceded to the state. In 1782
the town was purchased by Louis XVI. from its owners, the
Rohan-Guéméné family. In 1746 the English under Admiral
Richard Lestock made an unsuccessful attack on Lorient.</p>

proper form is with the <i>n</i>; a similar change is found in Latimer
for Latiner, the title of an old official of the royal household, the
king&rsquo;s interpreter), one who makes bits and spurs and the metal
mountings for saddles and bridles; the term is also applied to a
worker in wrought iron and to a maker of small iron ware. The

livery companies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Livery Company</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORIS,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> a name of uncertain origin applied to the Indo-Malay
representatives of the lemurs, which, together with the African
pottos, constitute the section <i>Nycticebinae</i> of the family <i>Nycticebidae</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Primates</a></span>). From their extremely slow movements
and lethargic habits in the daytime these weird little creatures
are commonly called sloths by Anglo-Indians. Their soft fur,
huge staring eyes, rudimentary tails and imperfectly developed
index-fingers render lorises easy of recognition. The smallest
is the slender loris (<i>Loris gracilis</i>) of the forests of Madras and
Ceylon, a creature smaller than a squirrel. It is of such exceeding
strangeness and beauty that it might have been thought it
would be protected by the natives; but they hold it alive before
a fire till its beautiful eyes burst in order to afford a supposed
remedy for ophthalmia! The mainland and Cingalese animals
form distinct races. Both in this species and the slow loris
there is a pair of rudimentary abdominal teats in addition to
the normal pectoral pair. The slow loris (<i>Nycticebus tardigradus</i>)
is a heavier built and larger animal, ranging from eastern Bengal
to Cochin China, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, Java and Sumatra.
There are several races, mostly grey in colour, but the Sumatran
<i>N. t. hilleri</i> is reddish.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORIS-MELIKOV, MICHAEL TARIELOVICH,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1825?-1888),
Russian statesman, son of an Armenian merchant, was
born at Tiflis in 1825 or 1826, and educated in St Petersburg,
first in the Lazarev School of Oriental Languages, and afterwards
in the Guards&rsquo; Cadet Institute. He joined a hussar regiment,
and four years afterwards (1847) he was sent to the Caucasus,
where he remained for more than twenty years, and made for
himself during troublous times the reputation of a distinguished
cavalry officer and an able administrator. In the latter capacity,
though a keen soldier, he aimed always at preparing the warlike
and turbulent population committed to his charge for the
transition from military to normal civil administration, and in
this work his favourite instrument was the schoolmaster. In
the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 he commanded a separate
corps d&rsquo;armée on the Turkish frontier in Asia Minor. After
taking the fortress of Ardahan, he was repulsed by Mukhtar
Pasha at Zevin, but subsequently defeated his opponent at
Aladja Dagh, took Kars by storm, and laid siege to Erzerum.
For these services he received the title of Count. In the following
year he was appointed temporary governor-general of the region
of the Lower Volga, to combat an outbreak of the plague. The
measures he adopted proved so effectual that he was transferred
to the provinces of Central Russia to combat the Nihilists and
Anarchists, who had adopted a policy of terrorism, and had
succeeded in assassinating the governor of Kharkov. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
success in this struggle led to his being appointed chief of the
Supreme Executive Commission which had been created in
St Petersburg to deal with the revolutionary agitation in general.
Here, as in the Caucasus, he showed a decided preference for
the employment of ordinary legal methods rather than exceptional
extra-legal measures, and an attempt on his own life soon
after he assumed office did not shake his convictions. In his
opinion the best policy was to strike at the root of the evil by
removing the causes of popular discontent, and for this purpose
he recommended to the emperor a large scheme of administrative
and economic reforms. Alexander II., who was beginning to
lose faith in the efficacy of the simple method of police repression
hitherto employed, lent a willing ear to the suggestion; and
when the Supreme Commission was dissolved in August 1880,
he appointed Count Loris-Melikov Minister of the Interior with
exceptional powers. The proposed scheme of reforms was at
once taken in hand, but it was never carried out. On the very
day in March 1881 that the emperor signed a ukaz creating
several commissions, composed of officials and eminent private
individuals, who should prepare reforms in various branches of
the administration, he was assassinated by Nihilist conspirators;
and his successor, Alexander III., at once adopted a strongly
reactionary policy. Count Loris-Melikov immediately resigned,
and lived in retirement until his death, which took place at Nice
on the 22nd of December 1888.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORRAINE,<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> one of the former provinces of France. The
name has designated different districts in different periods.
Lotharingia, or Lothringen, <i>i.e.</i> <i>regnum Lotharii</i>, is derived
from the <i>Lotharingi</i> or <i>Lotharienses</i> (O.G. <i>Lotheringen</i>, Fr.
<i>Loherains</i>, <i>Lorrains</i>), a term applied originally to the Frankish
subjects of Lothair, but restricted at the end of the 9th century
to those who dwelt north of the southern Vosges.</p>

<p><i>Lorraine in Medieval Times.</i>&mdash;The original kingdom of Lorraine
was the northern part of the territories allotted by the treaty
of Verdun (August 843) to the emperor Lothair I., and in 855
formed the inheritance of his second son, King Lothair. This
kingdom of Lorraine was situated between the realms of the
East and the West Franks, and originally extended along the
North Sea between the mouths of the Rhine and the Ems,
including the whole or part of Frisia and the cities on the right
bank of the Rhine. From Bonn the frontier followed the Rhine
as far as its confluence with the Aar, which then became the
boundary, receding from the left bank in the neighbourhood
of Bingen so as to leave the cities of Worms and Spires to
Germany, and embracing the duchy of Alsace. After crossing
the Jura, the frontier joined the Saône a little south of its confluence
with the Doubs, and followed the Saône for some distance,
and finally the valleys of the Meuse and the Scheldt. Thus the
kingdom roughly comprised the region watered by the Moselle
and the Meuse, together with the dioceses of Cologne, Trier,
Metz, Toul, Verdun, Liége and Cambrai, Basel, Strassburg
and Besançon, and corresponded to what is now Holland and
Belgium, parts of Rhenish Prussia, of Switzerland, and of the old
province of Franche-Comté, and to the district known later as
Upper Lorraine, or simply Lorraine. Though apparently of
an absolutely artificial character, this kingdom corresponded
essentially to the ancient Francia, the cradle of the Carolingian
house, and long retained a certain unity. It was to the inhabitants
of this region that the name of <i>Lotharienses</i> or <i>Lotharingi</i>
was primitively applied, although the word <i>Lotharingia</i>, as the
designation of the country, only appears in the middle of the

<p>The reign of King Lothair (<i>q.v.</i>), which was continually
disturbed by quarrels with his uncles, Charles the Bald and
Louis the German, and by the difficulties caused by the divorce
of his queen Teutberga, whom he had forsaken for a concubine
called Waldrada, ended on the 8th of August 869. His inheritance
was disputed by his uncles, and was divided by the treaty
of Meersen (8th of August 870), by which Charles the Bald
received part of the province of Besançon and some land between
the Moselle and the Meuse. Then for a time the emperor Charles
the Fat united under his authority the whole of the kingdom
of Lorraine with the rest of the Carolingian empire. After the
deposition of Charles in 888 Rudolph, king of Burgundy, got
himself recognized in Lorraine. He was unable to maintain
himself there, and succeeded in detaching definitively no more
than the province of Besançon. Lorraine remained in the
power of the emperor Arnulf, who in 895 constituted it a distinct
kingdom in favour of his son Zwentibold. Zwentibold quickly
became embroiled with the nobles and the bishops, and especially
with Bishop Radbod of Trier. Among the lay lords the most
important was Regnier (incorrectly called Long-neck), count of
Hesbaye and Hainault, who is styled duke by the Lotharingian
chronicler Reginon, though he does not appear ever to have
borne the title. In 898 Zwentibold stripped Regnier of his
fiefs, whereupon the latter appealed to the king of France,
Charles the Simple, whose intervention, however, had no enduring
effect. After the death of Arnulf in 899, the Lotharingians
appealed to his successor, Louis the Child, to replace Zwentibold,
who, on the 13th of August 900, was killed in battle. In spite
of the dissensions which immediately arose between him and the
Lotharingian lords, Louis retained the kingdom till his death.
The Lotharingians, however, refused to recognize the new
German king, Conrad I., and testified their attachment to the
Carolingian house by electing as sovereign the king of the West
Franks, Charles the Simple. Charles was at first supported
by Giselbert, son and successor of Regnier, but was abandoned
by his ally, who in 919 appealed to the German king, Henry I.
The struggle ended in the treaty of Bonn (921), by which apparently
the rights of Charles over Lorraine were recognized. The
revolt of the Frankish lords in 922 and the captivity of Charles
finally settled the question. After an unsuccessful attack by
Rudolph or Raoul, king of France, Henry became master of
Lorraine in 925, thanks to the support of Giselbert, whom he
rewarded with the hand of his daughter Gerberga and the title
of duke of Lorraine. Giselbert at first remained faithful to
Henry&rsquo;s son, Otto the Great, but in 938 he appears to have
joined the revolt directed against Otto by Eberhard, duke of
Franconia. In 939, in concert with Eberhard and Otto&rsquo;s
brother, Henry of Saxony, he declared open war against Otto
and appealed to Louis d&rsquo;Outremer, who penetrated into Lorraine
and Alsace, but was soon called back to France by the revolt
of the count of Vermandois. In the same year Giselbert and
Eberhard were defeated and killed near Andernach, and Otto
at once made himself recognized in the whole of Lorraine, securing
it by a treaty with Louis d&rsquo;Outremer, who married Giselbert&rsquo;s
widow Gerberga, and entrusting the government of it to Count
Otto, son of Ricuin, until Giselbert&rsquo;s son Henry should have
attained his majority.</p>

<p>After the deaths of the young Henry and Count Otto in 944,
Otto the Great gave Lorraine to Conrad the Red, duke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
Franconia, the husband of his daughter Liutgard, a choice which
was not completely satisfactory to the Lotharingians. In
953 Conrad, in concert with Liudulf, the son of the German
king, revolted against Otto, but was abandoned by his supporters.
Otto stripped Conrad of his duchy, and in 954 gave the government
of it to his own brother Bruno, archbishop of Cologne.
Bruno had to contend against the efforts of the last Carolingians
of France to make good their claims on Lorraine, as well as
against the spirit of independence exhibited by the Lotharingian
nobles; and his attempts to raze certain castles built by brigand
lords and to compel them to respect their oath of fidelity
resulted in serious sedition. To obviate these difficulties Bruno
divided the ducal authority, assigning Lower Lorraine to a certain
Duke Godfrey, who was styled <i>dux Ripuariorum</i>, and Upper
Lorraine to Frederick (d. 959), count of Bar, a member of the
house of Ardenne and son-in-law of Hugh the Great, with the
title of <i>dux Mosellanorum</i>; and it is probable that the partition
of the ancient kingdom of Lorraine into two new duchies was
confirmed by Otto after Bruno&rsquo;s death in 965. In 977 the
emperor Otto II. gave the government of Lower Lorraine to
Charles I., a younger son of Louis d&rsquo;Outremer, on condition
that that prince should acknowledge himself his vassal and
should oppose any attempt of his brother Lothair on Lorraine.
The consequent expedition of the king of France in 978 against
Aix-la-Chapelle had no enduring result, and Charles retained
his duchy till his death about 992. He left two sons, Otto,
who succeeded him and died without issue, and Henry, who
is sometimes regarded as the ancestor of the landgraves of
Thuringia. The duchy of Lower Lorraine, sometimes called
<i>Lothier</i> (<i>Lotharium</i>), was then given to Godfrey (d. 1023), son of
Count Godfrey of Verdun, and for some time the history of
Lorraine is the history of the attempts made by the dukes of
Lothier to seize Upper Lorraine. Gothelon (d. 1043), son of Duke
Godfrey, obtained Lorraine at the death of Frederick II., duke of
Upper Lorraine, in 1027, and victoriously repulsed the incursions
of Odo (Eudes) of Blois, count of Champagne, who was defeated
and killed in a battle near Bar (1037). At Gothelon&rsquo;s death in
1043, his son Godfrey the Bearded received from the emperor
only Lower Lorraine, his brother Gothelon II. obtaining Upper
Lorraine. Godfrey attempted to seize the upper duchy, but was
defeated and imprisoned in 1045. On the death of Gothelon
in 1046, Godfrey endeavoured to take Upper Lorraine from
Albert of Alsace, to whom it had been granted by the emperor
Henry III. The attempt, however, also failed; and Godfrey
was for some time deprived of his own duchy of Lower Lorraine
in favour of Frederick of Luxemburg. Godfrey took part in the
struggles of Pope Leo IX. against the Normans in Italy, and in
1053 married Beatrice, daughter of Duke Frederick of Upper
Lorraine and widow of Boniface, margrave of Tuscany. On the
death of Frederick of Luxemburg in 1065 the emperor Henry IV.
restored the duchy of Lower Lorraine to Godfrey, who retained
it till his death in 1069, when he was succeeded by his son Godfrey
the Hunchback (d. 1076), after whose death Henry IV. gave the
duchy to Godfrey of Bouillon, the hero of the first crusade, son
of Eustace, count of Boulogne, and Ida, sister of Godfrey the
Hunchback. On the death of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1100
Lower Lorraine was given to Henry, count of Limburg. The
new duke supported the emperor Henry IV. in his struggles
with his sons, and in consequence was deposed by the emperor
Henry V., who gave the duchy in 1106 to Godfrey, count of
Louvain, a descendant of the Lotharingian dukes of the beginning
of the 10th century. This Godfrey was the first hereditary duke
of Brabant, as the dukes of Lower Lorraine came to be called.</p>

<p><i>Upper Lorraine</i>.&mdash;The duchy of Upper Lorraine, or Lorraine
<i>Mosellana</i>, to which the name of Lorraine was restricted from
the 11th century, consisted of a tract of undulating country
watered by the upper course of the Meuse and Moselle, and
bounded N. by the Ardennes, S. by the table-land of Langres,
E. by the Vosges and W. by Champagne. Its principal fiefs
were the countship of Bar which Otto the Great gave in 951
to Count Frederick of Ardenne, and which passed in 1093 to the
lords of Montbéliard; the countship of Chiny, formed at the end
of the 10th century, of which, since the 13th, Montmédy was
the capital; the lordship of Commercy, whose rulers bore the
special title of <i>damoiseau</i>, and which passed in the 13th century
to the house of Saarebrücken; and, finally the three important
ecclesiastical lordships of the bishops of Metz, Toul and Verdun.
Theodoric, or Thierri (d. 1026), son of Frederick, count of Bar
and first duke of Upper Lorraine, was involved in a war with the
emperor Henry II., a war principally remarkable for the siege
of Metz (1007). After having been the object of numerous
attempts on the part of the dukes of Lower Lorraine, Upper
Lorraine was given by the emperor Henry III. to Albert of Alsace,
and passed in 1048 to Albert&rsquo;s brother Gerard, who died by
poison in 1069, and who was the ancestor of the hereditary
house of Lorraine. Until the 15th century the representatives
of the hereditary house were Theodoric II., called the Valiant
(1069-1115), Simon (1115-1139), Matthew (1139-1176), Simon II.
(1176-1205), Ferri I. (1205-1206), Ferri II. (1206-1213), Theobald
(Thibaut) I. (1213-1220), Matthew II. (1220-1251), Ferri III.
(1251-1304), Theobald II. (1304-1312), Ferri IV., called the
Struggler (1312-1328), Rudolph, or Raoul (1328-1346), John
(1346-1391) and Charles II. or I., called the Bold (1391-1431).
The 12th century and the first part of the 13th were occupied
with wars against the counts of Bar and Champagne. Theobald
I. intervened in Champagne to support Erard of Brienne against
the young count Theobald IV. The regent of Champagne,
Blanche of Navarre, succeeded in forming against the duke of
Lorraine a coalition consisting of the count of Bar and the
emperor Frederick II., who had become embroiled with Theobald
over the question of Rosheim in Alsace. Attacked by the
emperor, the duke of Lorraine was forced at the treaty of Amance
(1218) to acknowledge himself the vassal of the count of Champagne,
and to support the count in his struggles against his
ancient ally the count of Bar. The long government of Ferri III.
was mainly occupied with wars against the feudal lords and the
bishop of Metz, which resulted in giving an impulse to the
municipal movement through Ferri&rsquo;s attempt to use the movement
as a weapon against the nobles. The majority of the
municipal charters of Lorraine were derived from the charter
of Beaumont in Argonne, which was at first extended to the
Barrois and was granted by Ferri, in spite of the hostility of
his barons, to La Neuveville in 1257, to Frouard in 1263 and to
Lunéville in 1265. In the church lands the bishops of Toul and
Metz granted liberties from the end of the 12th century to the
communes in their lordship, but not the Beaumont charter,
which, however, obtained in the diocese of Verdun in the 14th
and 15th centuries.</p>

<p>By the will of Duke Charles the Bold, Lorraine was to pass
to his daughter Isabella, who married René of Anjou, duke of
Bar, in 1420. But Anthony of Vaudemont, Charles&rsquo;s nephew
and heir male, disputed this succession with René, who obtained
from the king of France an army commanded by Arnault
Guilhem de Barbazan. René, however, was defeated and taken
prisoner at the battle of Bulgnéville, where Barbazan was
killed (2nd of July 1431). The negotiations between René&rsquo;s
wife and Anthony had no result, in spite of the intervention
of the council of Basel and the emperor Sigismund, and it was
not until 1436 that René obtained his liberty by paying a
ransom of 200,000 crowns, and was enabled to dispute with
Alfonso of Aragon the kingdom of Naples, which he had inherited
in the previous year. In 1444 Charles VII. of France and the
dauphin Louis went to Lorraine, accompanied by envoys from
Henry VI. of England, and procured a treaty (confirmed at
Chalons in 1445), by which Yolande, René&rsquo;s eldest daughter,
married Anthony&rsquo;s son, Ferri of Vaudemont, and René&rsquo;s second
daughter Margaret became the wife of Henry VI. of England.
After his return to Lorraine in 1442, René was seldom in the
duchy. Like his successor John, duke of Calabria, who died
in 1470, he was continually occupied with expeditions in Italy
or in Spain. John&rsquo;s son and successor, Nicholas (d. 1473), who
supported the duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, against
the king of France, died without children, and his heir was
René, son of Frederick of Vaudemont. The duke of Burgundy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
however, disputed this inheritance, and carried off the young
René and his mother, but on the intervention of Louis XI. had
to set them at liberty. René helped the Swiss during their
wars with Charles the Bold, who invaded Lorraine and was
killed under the walls of Nancy (1477). René&rsquo;s last years
were mainly spent in expeditions in Provence and Italy. He
died in 1508, leaving by his second wife three sons&mdash;Anthony,
called the Good, who succeeded him; Claude, count (and
afterwards duke) of Guise, the ancestor of the house of Guise;
and John (d. 1550), known as the cardinal of Lorraine. Anthony,
who was declared of age at his father&rsquo;s death by the estates
of Lorraine, although his mother had tried to seize the power
as regent, had been brought up from the age of twelve at the
French court, where he became the friend of Louis XII., whom
he accompanied on his Italian expeditions. In 1525 he had to
defend Lorraine against the revolted Alsatian peasants known
as <i>rustauds</i> (boors), whom he defeated at Lupstein and Scherweiler;
and he succeeded in maintaining a neutral position in
the struggle between Francis I. of France and the emperor
Charles V. He died on the 14th of June 1544, and was succeeded
by his son Francis I., who died of apoplexy (August 1545) at
the very moment when he was negotiating peace between the
king of France and the emperor.</p>

<p><i>Lorraine in Modern Times</i>.&mdash;Francis&rsquo;s son Charles III. or II.,
called the Great, succeeded under the tutelage of his mother
and Nicholas of Vaudemont, bishop of Metz. Henry II. of
France took this opportunity to invade Lorraine, and in 1552
seized the three bishoprics of Metz, Toul and Verdun. In the
same year the emperor laid siege to Metz, but was forced to
retreat with heavy loss before the energetic resistance of Duke
Francis of Guise. On leaving Lorraine, Henry II. took Charles
to France, brought him up at the court and married him to his
daughter Claude. After the accession of Francis II., the young
duke returned to Lorraine, and, while his cousins the Guises
endeavoured to make good the claims of the house of Lorraine
to the crown of France by virtue of its descent from the Carolingians
through Charles, the son of Louis d&rsquo;Outremer, he devoted
himself mainly to improving the administration of his duchy.
He reconstituted his domain by revoking the alienations irregularly
granted by his predecessors, instructed his <i>chambre des
comptes</i> to institute inquiries on this subject, and endeavoured to
ameliorate the condition of industry and commerce by reorganizing
the working of the mines and saltworks, unifying
weights and measures and promulgating edicts against vagabonds.
His duchy suffered considerably from the passage of German
bands on their way to help the Protestants in France, and also
from disturbances caused by the progress of Calvinism,
especially in the neighbourhood of the three bishoprics. To
combat Calvinism Charles had recourse to the Jesuits, whom
he established at Pont-à Mousson, and to whom he gave over
the university he had founded in that town in 1572. To this
foundation he soon added chairs of medicine and law, the first
professor of civil law being the <i>maître des requêtes</i>, the Scotsman
William Barclay, and the next Gregory of Toulouse, a pupil
of the jurist Cujas. Charles died on the 14th of May 1608, and
was succeeded by his eldest son Henry II., called the Good,
who rid Lorraine of the German bands and died in 1624 without
issue.</p>

<p>Henry was succeeded by his brother Francis II., who abdicated
on the 26th of November 1624 in favour of his son Charles IV.
or III. At the beginning of the reign of Louis XIII. Charles
embroiled himself with France by harbouring French malcontents.
Louis entered Lorraine, and by the treaty of Vic (31st of
December 1631) bound over Charles to desist from supporting
the enemies of France, and compelled him to cede the fortress
of Marsal. Charles&rsquo;s breach of this treaty led to a renewal of
hostilities, and the French troops occupied St Mihiel, Bar-le-duc,
Pont-à-Mousson and Nancy, which the duke was forced to cede
for four years (1633). In 1632, by the treaty of Liverdun, he
had already had to abandon the fortresses of Stenay and Clermont
in Argonne. On the 19th of January 1634 he abdicated in
favour of his younger brother Francis Nicholas, cardinal of
Lorraine, and withdrew to Germany, the parlement of Paris
declaring him guilty of rebellion and confiscating his estates.
After vain attempts to regain his estates with the help of the
emperor, he decided to negotiate with France; and the treaty
of St Germain (29th of March 1641) re-established him in his
duchy on condition that he should cede Nancy, Stenay and
other fortresses until the general peace. This treaty he soon
broke, joining the Imperialists in the Low Countries and defeating
the French at Tuttlingen (December 1643). He was restored,
however, to his estates in 1644, and took part in the wars of the
Fronde. He was arrested at Brussels in 1654, imprisoned at
Toledo and did not recover his liberty until the peace of the
Pyrenees in 1659. On the 28th of February 1661 the duchies
of Lorraine and Bar were restored to him by the treaty of
Vincennes, on condition that he should demolish the fortifications
of Nancy and cede Clermont, Saarburg and Pfalzburg. In
1662 Hugues de Lionne negotiated with him the treaty of
Montmartre, by which Charles sold the succession to the duchy
to Louis XIV. for a life-rent; but the Lorrainers, perhaps
with the secret assent of their prince, refused to ratify the treaty.
Charles, too, was accused of intriguing with the Dutch, and was
expelled from his estates, Marshal de Créqui occupying Lorraine.
He withdrew to Germany, and in 1673 took an active part in
the coalition of Spain, the Empire and Holland against France.
After an unsuccessful invasion of Franche-Comté he took his
revenge by defeating Créqui at Conzer Brücke (11th of August
1675) and forcing him to capitulate at Trier. On the 18th of
September 1675 died this adventurous prince, who, as Voltaire
said, passed his life in losing his estates. His brother Francis,
in favour of whom he had abdicated, was a cardinal at the age of
nineteen and subsequently bishop of Toul, although he had
never taken orders. He obtained a dispensation to marry his
cousin, Claude of Lorraine, and died in 1670. He had one son,
Charles, who in 1675 took the title of duke of Lorraine and was
recognized by all the powers except France. After an unsuccessful
attempt to seize Lorraine in 1676, Charles vainly solicited
the throne of Poland, took an active part in the wars in Hungary,
and married Eleanor of Austria, sister of the emperor Leopold I.,
in 1678. At the treaty of Nijmwegen France proposed to restore
his estates on condition that he should abandon a part of them;
but Charles refused, and passed the rest of his life in Austria,
where he took part in the wars against the Turks, whom he
defeated at Mohacz (1687). He died in 1690.</p>

<p>Leopold, Charles&rsquo;s son and successor, was restored to his
estates by the treaty of Ryswick (1697), but had to dismantle
all the fortresses in Lorraine and to disband his army with the
exception of his guard. Under his rule Lorraine flourished.
While diminishing the taxes, he succeeded in augmenting
his revenues by wise economy. The population increased
enormously during his reign&mdash;that of Nancy, for instance,
almost trebling itself between the years 1699 and 1735. Leopold
welcomed French immigrants, and devoted himself to the
development of commerce and industry, particularly to the
manufacture of stuffs and lace, glass and paper. He was responsible,
too, for the compilation of a body of law which was known
as the &ldquo;Code Léopold.&rdquo; Some time after his death, which
occurred on the 27th of March 1729, his heir Francis III. was
betrothed to Maria Theresa of Austria, the daughter and heiress
of the emperor Charles VI. France, however, could not admit
the possibility of a union of Lorraine with the Empire; and in
1735, at the preliminaries of Vienna, Louis XV. negotiated an
arrangement by which Francis received the duchy of Tuscany,
which was vacant by the death of the last Medici, in exchange
for Lorraine, and Stanislaus Leszczynski, the dethroned king of
Poland and father-in-law of Louis XV., obtained Lorraine, which
after his death would pass to his daughter&mdash;in other words,
to France. These arrangements were confirmed by the treaty
of Vienna (18th of November 1738). In 1736, by a secret agreement,
Stanislaus had abandoned the financial administration
of his estates to Louis XV. for a yearly subsidy. The intendant,
Chaumont de la Galaizière, was instructed to apply the French
system of taxation in Lorraine; and in spite of the severity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
the administration Lorraine preserved a grateful memory of
the good king Stanislaus, who held his brilliant little court at
Lunéville, and founded an academy and several libraries and
hospitals. At his death in February 1766 the two duchies of
Lorraine and Bar became definitively incorporated in the
kingdom of France. The treaties of 1735 and 1736, however,
guaranteed their legislation, the privileges enjoyed by the three
orders, and their common law and customs tariffs, which they
retained until the French Revolution. Lorraine and Barrois
formed a large government corresponding, together with the
little government of the three bishoprics, to the <i>intendance</i> of
Lorraine and the <i>généralité</i> of Metz. For legal purposes, Metz
had been the seat of a parlement since 1633, and the parlement
of Nancy was created in 1776. There was, too, a <i>chambre des
comptes</i> at Metz, and another at Bar-le-duc. (For the later
history see Alsace-Lorraine.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORTZING, GUSTAV ALBERT<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (1801-1851), German composer,
was born at Berlin on the 23rd of October 1801. Both his
parents were actors, and when he was nineteen the son began
to play youthful lover at the theatres of Düsseldorf and Aachen,
sometimes also singing in small tenor or baritone parts. His
first opera <i>Ali Pascha von Jannina</i> appeared in 1824, but his
fame as a musician rests chiefly upon the two operas <i>Der Wildschütz</i>
(1842) and <i>Czar und Zimmermann</i> (1837). The latter,
although now regarded as one of the masterpieces of German
comic opera, was received with little enthusiasm by the public
of Leipzig. Subsequent performance in Berlin, however, provoked
such a tempest of applause that the opera was soon placed on
all the stages of Germany. It was translated into English,
French, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Bohemian, Hungarian and
Russian. <i>Der Wildschütz</i> was based on a comedy of Kotzebue,
and was a satire on the unintelligent and exaggerated admiration
for the highest beauty in art expressed by the <i>bourgeois gentilhomme</i>.
Of his other operas it is only necessary to note <i>Der
Pole und sein Kind</i>, produced shortly after the Polish insurrection
of 1831, and <i>Undine</i> (1845). Lortzing died at Berlin on the
21st of January 1851.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORY, CHARLES<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (1823-1889), French geologist, was born
at Nantes on the 30th of July 1823. He graduated <i>D. ès Sc.</i>
in 1847; in 1852 he was appointed to the chair of geology at
the University of Grenoble, and in 1881 to that of the <i>École
Normale Supérieure</i> in Paris. He was distinguished for his
researches on the geology of the French Alps, being engaged on
the geological survey of the departments of Isère, Drôme and
the Hautes Alpes, of which he prepared the maps and explanatory
memoirs. He dealt with some of the disturbances in the Savoy
Alps, describing the fan-like structures, and confirming the views
of J. A. Favre with regard to the overthrows, reversals and
duplication of the strata. His contributions to geological
literature include also descriptions of the fossils and stratigraphical
divisions of the Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks
of the Jura. He died at Grenoble on the 3rd of May 1889.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORY<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> (a word of Malayan origin signifying parrot, in general
use with but slight variation of form in many European languages),
the name of certain birds of the order <i>Psittaci</i>, mostly from the
Moluccas and New Guinea, remarkable for their bright scarlet
or crimson colouring, though also, and perhaps subsequently,
applied to some others in which the plumage is chiefly green.
The lories have been referred to a considerable number of genera,
of which <i>Lorius</i> (the <i>Domicella</i> of some authors), <i>Eos</i> and
<i>Chalcopsittacus</i> may be here particularized, while under the name
of &ldquo;lorikeets&rdquo; may be comprehended such genera as <i>Trichoglossus</i>,
<i>Charmosyna</i>, <i>Loriculus</i> and <i>Coriphilus</i>. By most
systematists some of these forms have been placed far apart,
even in different families of <i>Psittaci</i>, but A. H. Garrod has
shown (<i>Proc. Zool. Society</i>, 1874, pp. 586-598, and 1876, p. 692)
the many common characters they possess, which thus goes
some way to justify the relationship implied by their popular
designation. A full account of these birds is given in the first
part of Count T. Salvadori&rsquo;s <i>Ornitologia della Papuasia e delle
Molucche</i> (Turin 1880), whilst a later classification appeared in
Salvadori&rsquo;s section of the British Museum <i>Catalogue of Birds</i>,
xx., 1891.</p>

<p>Though the name lory has often been used for the species
of <i>Eclectus</i>, and some other genera related thereto, modern
writers would restrict its application to the birds of the genera
<i>Lorius</i>, <i>Eos</i>, <i>Chalcopsittacus</i> and their near allies, which are
often placed in a subfamily, <i>Loriinae</i>, belonging to the so-called
family of <i>Trichoglossidae</i> or &ldquo;brush-tongued&rdquo; parrots. Garrod
in his investigations on the anatomy of <i>Psittaci</i> was led not to
attach much importance to the structure indicated by the
epithet &ldquo;brush-tongued&rdquo; stating (<i>Proc. Zool. Society</i>, 1874,
p. 597) that it &ldquo;is only an excessive development of the papillae
which are always found on the lingual surface.&rdquo; The birds
of this group are very characteristic of the New Guinea subregion,<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
in which occur, according to Count Salvadori, ten species of
<i>Lorius</i>, eight of <i>Eos</i> and four of <i>Chalcopsittacus</i>; but none
seem here to require any further notice,<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a> though among them,
and particularly in the genus <i>Eos</i>, are included some of the
most richly-coloured birds in the whole world; nor does it
appear that more need be said of the lorikeets.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOS ANGELES,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Los Angeles
county, in southern California, U.S.A., along the small Los
Angeles river, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains;
a narrow strip, 18 m. long, joins the main part of the city to
its water front on the ocean, San Pedro Bay. Pop. (1880)
11,183, (1890) 50,395, (1900) 102,479, of whom 19,964 were
foreign-born;<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the growth in population since 1900 has been
very rapid and in 1910 it was 319,198. The city had in
1910 an area of 85.1 sq. m., of which more than one-half has been
added since 1890. Los Angeles is served by the Southern
Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fé, and the San Pedro, Los
Angeles &amp; Salt Lake railways; by steamers to San Francisco;
and by five systems of urban and suburban electric railways,
which have 300 m. of track within the city and 700 m. within a
radius of 30 m. beyond its limits. Inclined railways ascend
Third Street Hill and Court Street Hill, in the heart of the city;
and a system of subways extends from the centre of the city
to its western limits. The harbour, San Pedro Bay, originally
open and naturally poor, has been greatly improved by the
Federal government; a breakwater 9250 ft. long was begun in
1898 and the bar has been deepened, and further improvements
of the inner harbour at Wilmington (which is nearly landlocked
by a long narrow island lying nearly east and west across its
mouth) were begun in 1907. Important municipal docks have
been built by the city.</p>

<p>The situation of the city between the mountains and the
sea is attractive. The site of the business district is level, and
its plan regular; the suburbs are laid out on hills. Although
not specifically a health resort, Los Angeles enjoys a high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
reputation for its climate. From July 1877 to 1908 (inclusive)
the mean of the minima for January, the coldest month of the
year, was 44.16° F.; the mean of the minima for August, the
warmest month, was 60.1° F.; and the difference of the mean
temperature of the coldest and the warmest month was about
18° F.; while on five days only in this period (and on no day in
the years 1904-1908) did the official thermometer fall below
32° F. There are various pleasure resorts in the mountains,
and among seaside resorts are Santa Monica, Ocean Park, Venice,
Playa del Rey, Hermosa, Redondo, Terminal Island, Long Beach,
Alamitos Bay, Huntington Beach, Newport, Balboa and Corona
del Mar. There are excellent roads throughout the country.
Los Angeles has beautiful shade trees and a wealth of semi-tropic
vegetation. Its residential portions are characterized by
detached homes set in ample and beautiful grounds. Towering
eucalyptus, graceful pepper trees, tropic palms, rubber trees,
giant bananas, yuccas and a wonderful growth of roses, heliotrope,
calla lilies in hedges, orange trees, jasmine, giant geraniums
and other flowers beautify the city throughout the year. There
are 22 parks, with about 3800 acres within or on the borders
of the city limits; among the parks are Griffith (3015 acres),
Elysian (532 acres), Eastlake (57 acres), Westlake (35 acres)
and Echo (38 acres). The old Spanish-Moorish mission architecture
has considerably influenced building styles. Among the
important buildings are the Federal Building, the County Court
House, the City Hall, a County Hall of Records, the Public
Library with about 110,000 volumes in 1908, the large Auditorium
and office buildings and the Woman&rsquo;s Club. The exhibit in
the Chamber of Commerce Building illustrates the resources
of southern California. Here also are the Coronel Collection,
given in 1901 by Dona Mariana, the widow of Don Antonio
Coronel, and containing relics of the Spanish and Mexican
régime in California; and the Palmer Collection of Indian
antiquities. In Los Angeles also are the collections of the
Southwest Society (1904; for southern California, Arizona and
New Mexico) of the Archaeological Institute of America. On
the outskirts of the city, near Eastlake Park, is the Indian
Crafts Exhibition, which contains rare collections of aboriginal
handiwork, and where Indians may be seen making baskets,
pottery and blankets. Of interest to visitors is that part of the
city called Sonora Town, with its adobe houses, Mexican quarters,
old Plaza and the Church of Our Lady, Queen of the Angels
(first erected in 1822; rebuilt in 1861), which contains interesting
paintings by early Indian converts. Near Sonora Town is the
district known as Chinatown. The principal educational
institutions are the University of Southern California (Methodist
Episcopal, 1880), the Maclay College of Theology and a
preparatory school; Occidental College (Presbyterian, 1887),
St Vincent&rsquo;s College (Roman Catholic, founded 1865; chartered
1869) and the Los Angeles State Normal School (1882).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The economic interests of Los Angeles centre in the culture of
fruits. The surrounding country is very fertile when irrigated,
producing oranges, lemons, figs and other semi-tropical fruits.
Thousands of artesian wells have been bored, the region between
Los Angeles, Santa Clara and San Bernardino being one of the most
important artesian well regions of the world. The city, which then
got its water supply from the Los Angeles river bed, in 1907 authorized
the issue of $23,000,000 worth of 4% bonds for the construction
of an aqueduct 209 m. long, bringing water to the city from the
Owens river, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It was estimated
that the project would furnish water for one million people, beside
supplying power for lighting, manufacturing and transportation
purposes. All the water in excess of the city&rsquo;s actual needs may be
employed for irrigation. Work on the aqueduct was begun in 1908,
and it was to be completed in five years. From 1900 to 1905
the value of the factory products increased from $15,133,696 to
$34,814,475 or 130%, and the capital employed in manufactures
from $10,045,095 to $28,181,418 or 180.5%. The leading manufacturing
industries in 1905, with the product-value of each in this
year, were slaughtering and meat-packing ($4,040,162), foundry
and machine shop work ($3,146,914), flour and grist milling
($2,798,740), lumber manufacturing and planing ($2,519,081),
printing and publishing (newspapers and periodicals, $2,097,339;
and book and job printing, $1,278,841), car construction and repairing
($1,549,836)&mdash;in 1910 there were railway shops here of the
Southern Pacific, Pacific Electric, Los Angeles Street, Salt Lake and
Santa Fé railways&mdash;and the manufacture of confectionery ($953,915),
furniture ($879,910) and malt liquors ($789,393). The canning and
preserving of fruits and vegetables are important industries. There
is a large wholesale trade with southern California, with Arizona and
with the gold-fields of Nevada, with which Los Angeles is connected
by railway. Los Angeles is a port of entry, but its foreign commerce
is relatively unimportant. The value of its imports increased from
$721,705 in 1905 to $1,654,549 in 1907; in 1908 the value was
$1,193,552. The city&rsquo;s exports were valued at $45,000 in 1907 and
at $306,439 in 1908. The coastwise trade is in lumber (about
700,000,000 ft. annually), shipped from northern California, Oregon
and Washington, and in crude oil and general merchandise. There
are rich oil-fields N. and W. of the city and wells throughout the city;
petroleum is largely employed as fuel in factories. The central
field, the Second Street Park field in the city, was developed between
1892 and 1895 and wells were drilled farther E. until in 1896 the
eastern field was tapped with wells at Adobe and College streets;
the wells within the city are gradually being abandoned. The
western field and the western part of the central field were first
worked in 1899-1900. The Salt Lake field, controlled by the Salt
Lake Oil Company, near Rancho de Brea, W.S.W. of the city, first
became important in 1902 and in 1907 it was the most valuable field
in California, S. of Santa Barbara county, and the value of its product
was $1,749,980. In 1905 the value of petroleum refined in Los
Angeles was $461,281.</p>

<p>Land has not for many years been cheap (<i>i.e.</i> absolutely) in the
southern Californian fruit country, and immigration has been, generally,
of the comparatively well-to-do. This fact has greatly affected
the character and development of the city. The assessed valuation
of property increased more than threefold from 1900 to 1910, being
$276,801,517 in the latter year, when the bonded city debt was
$17,259,312.50. Since 1896 there has been a strong independent
movement in politics, marked by the organization of a League for
Better City Government (1896) and a Municipal League (1900),
and by the organization of postal primaries to secure the co-operation
of electors pledged to independent voting. Since 1904 the public
school system has been administered by a non-partisan Board of
Education chosen from the city at large, and not by wards as theretofore.</p>
</div>

<p>Los Angeles, like all other Californian cities, has the privilege
of making and amending its own charter, subject to the approval
of the state legislature. In 1902 thirteen amendments were
adopted, including provisions for the initiative, the referendum
and the recall. The last of these provides that 25% of
the voters choosing a municipal officer may, by signing a
petition for his recall, force a new election during his term of
office and thereby remove him if another candidate receives a
greater number of votes. This provision, introducing an
entirely new principle into the American governmental system,
came into effect in January 1903, and was employed in the
following year when a previously elected councilman who was
&ldquo;recalled&rdquo; by petition and was unsuccessful in the 1904 election
brought suit to hold his office, and on a mere technicality the
Supreme Court of the state declared the recall election invalid.
In 1909 there was a recall election at which a mayor was removed
and another chosen in his place.</p>

<p>The Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles was
founded in 1781. The Franciscan mission of San Gabriel&mdash;still
a famous landmark&mdash;had been established ten years earlier a
few miles eastward. Beginning about 1827, Los Angeles, being
the largest pueblo of the territory, became a rival of Monterey
for the honour of being the capital of California, was the seat of
conspiracies to overthrow the Mexican authority, and the
stronghold of the South California party in the bickerings and
struggles that lasted down to the American occupation. In
1835 it was made a city by the Mexican Congress, and declared
the capital, but the last provision was not enforced and was
soon recalled. In 1836-1838 it was the headquarters of C. A.
Carrillo, a legally-named but never <i>de facto</i> governor of California,
whose jurisdiction was never recognized in the north; and in
1845-1847 it was the actual capital. The city was rent by
factional quarrels when war broke out between Mexico and the
United States, but the appearance of United States troops under
Commodore Robert F. Stockton and General John C. Frémont
before Los Angeles caused both factions to unite against a
common foe. The defenders of Los Angeles fled at the approach
of the troops, and on the 13th of August 1846 the American flag
was raised over the city. A garrison of fifty men, left in control,
was compelled in October to withdraw on account of a revolt
of the inhabitants, and Los Angeles was not retaken until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
General Philip Kearny and Commodore Stockton entered the
city on the 18th of January 1847. This was the only important
overt resistance to the establishment of the new régime in
California. The city was chartered in 1850. It continued to
grow steadily thereafter until it attained railway connexion
with the Central Pacific and San Francisco in 1876, and with
the East by the Santa Fé system in 1885. The completion of
the latter line precipitated one of the most extraordinary of
American railway wars and land booms, which resulted in giving
southern California a great stimulus. The growth of the city
since 1890 has been even more remarkable. In 1909 the township
of Wilmington (pop. in 1900, 2983), including the city of San
Pedro (pop. in 1900, 1787), Colegrove, a suburb W.N.W. of the
city, Cahuenga (pop. in 1900, 1586), a township N.W. of the
former city limits, and a part of Los Feliz were annexed to the
city.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOS ISLANDS<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Islas de los Idolos</span>), a group of islands
off the coast of French Guinea, West Africa, lying south of
Sangarea Bay, between 9° 25&prime; and 9° 31&prime; N. and 13° 46&prime; and
13° 51&prime; W., and about 80 m. N.N.W. of Freetown, Sierra Leone.
There are five principal islands: Tamara, Factory, Crawford,
White (or Ruma) and Coral. The two largest islands are Tamara
and Factory, Tamara, some 8 m. long by 1 to 2 m. broad, being
the largest. These two islands lie parallel to each other, Tamara
to the west; they form a sort of basin, in the centre of which
is the islet of Crawford. The two other islands are to the south.
The archipelago is of volcanic formation, Tamara and Factory
islands forming part of a ruined crater, with Crawford Island
as the cone. The highest point is a knoll, some 450 ft. above
sea-level, in Tamara. All the islands are richly clothed with
palm trees and flowering underwood. Tamara has a good
harbour, and contains the principal settlement. The inhabitants,
about 1500, are immigrants of the Baga tribe of Senegambian
negroes, whose home is the coast land between the Pongo and
Nunez rivers. These are chiefly farmers. The Church of England
has a flourishing mission, with a native pastorate. At one time
the islands were a great seat of slave-traders and pirates. The
latter are supposed to have buried large amounts of treasure in
them. In an endeavour to stop the slave trade and piracy, the
islands were garrisoned (1812-1813) by British troops, but the
unhealthiness of the climate led to their withdrawal. In 1818
Sir Charles McCarthy, governor of Sierra Leone, obtained the
cession of the islands to Great Britain from the chiefs of the
Baga country, and in 1882 France recognized them to be a
British possession. They were then the headquarters of several
Sierra Leone traders. By article 6 of the Anglo-French convention
of the 8th of April 1904, the islands were ceded to France.
They were desired by France because of their geographical
position, Konakry, the capital of French Guinea, being built
on an islet but 3 m. from Factory Island, and at the mercy
of long range artillery planted thereon. The islands derive
their name from the sacred images found on them by the early
European navigators.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOSSIEMOUTH,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> a police burgh of Elginshire, Scotland.
Pop. (1901) 3904. It embraces the villages of Lossiemouth,
Branderburgh and Stotfield, at the mouth of the Lossie, 5½ m.
N.N.E. of Elgin, of which it is the port, by a branch line of the
Great North of Scotland railway. The industries are boat-building
and fishing. Lossiemouth, or the Old Town, dates
from 1700; Branderburgh, farther north, grew with the harbour
and began about 1830; Stotfield is purely modern and contiguous
to the splendid golf-course. The cliffs at Covesea, 2 m. W.,
contain caves of curious shape. Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstown
used one as a stable in the rebellion of 1745; weapons of
prehistoric man were found in another, and the roof of a third
is carved with ornaments and emblems of early Celtic art.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Kinneddar Castle in the parish of Drainie&mdash;in which Lossiemouth
is situated&mdash;was a seat of the bishops of Moray, and Old Duffus
Castle, 2½ m. S.W., was built in the reign of David II. The estate of
Gordonstown, close by, was founded by Sir Robert Gordon (1580-1656),
historian of the Sutherland family, and grandfather of the
baronet who, because of his inventions and scientific attainments,
was known locally as &ldquo;Sir Robert the Warlock&rdquo; (1647-1704).
Nearly midway between Lossiemouth and Elgin stand the massive
ruins of the palace of Spynie, formerly a fortified residence of the
bishops of Moray. &ldquo;Davie&rsquo;s Tower,&rdquo; 60 ft. high with walls 9 ft.
thick, was built by Bishop David Stewart about 1470. The adjacent
loch is a favourite breeding-place for the sea-birds, which resort to
the coast of Elginshire in enormous numbers. A mile S.E. of the
lake lies Pitgaveny, one of the reputed scenes of the murder of King
Duncan by Macbeth.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOSSING, BENSON JOHN<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (1813-1891), American historical
writer, was born in Beekman, New York, on the 12th of February
1813. After editing newspapers in Poughkeepsie he became
an engraver on wood, and removed to New York in 1839 for the
practice of his profession, to which he added that of drawing
illustrations for books and periodicals. He likewise wrote or
edited the text of numerous publications. His <i>Pictorial Field-Book
of the Revolution</i> (first issued in 30 parts, 1850-1852, and
then in 2 volumes) was a pioneer work of value in American
historical literature. In its preparation he travelled some
9000 m. during a period of nearly two years; made more than
a thousand sketches of extant buildings, battlefields, &amp;c.; and
presented his material in a form serviceable to the topographer
and interesting to the general reader. Similar but less characteristic
and less valuable undertakings were a <i>Pictorial Field-Book
of the War of 1812</i> (1868), and a <i>Pictorial History of the Civil
War in the United States of America</i> (3 vols. 1866-1869). His
other books were numerous: an <i>Outline History of the Fine
Arts</i>; many illustrated histories, large and small, of the United
States; popular descriptions of Mount Vernon and other
localities associated with famous names; and biographical
sketches of celebrated Americans, of which <i>The Life and Times
of Major-General Philip Schuyler</i> (2 vols. 1860-1873) was the
most considerable. He died at Dover Plains, New York, on
the 3rd of June 1891.</p>

it from the north winds, and so warm and healthy is the climate
that it has gained for the district the appellation of the &ldquo;Saxon

<p><span class="bold">LOST PROPERTY.<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> The man who loses an article does not
lose his right thereto, and he may recover it from the holder
whoever he be, unless his claim be barred by some Statute of
Limitations or special custom, as sale in market overt. The
rights and duties of the finder are more complex. If he know
or can find out the true owner, and yet convert the article to
his own use, he is guilty of theft. But if the true owner cannot
be discovered, the finder keeps the property, his title being
superior to that of every one except the true owner. But this
is only if the find be in public or some public place. Thus
if you pick up bank notes in a shop where they have been lost
by a stranger, and hand them to the shopkeeper that he may
discover and repossess the true owner, and he fail to do so, then
you can recover them from him. The owner of private land,
however, is entitled to what is found on it. Thus a man sets
you to clear out his pond, and you discover a diamond in the
mud at the bottom. The law will compel you to hand it over
to the owner of the pond. This applies even against the tenant.
A gas company were lessees of certain premises; whilst making
excavations therein they came upon a prehistoric boat; and
they were forced to surrender it to their lessor. An aerolite
becomes the property of the owner of the land on which it falls,
and not of the person finding or digging it out. The principle
of these three last cases is that whatever becomes part of the
soil belongs to the proprietor of that soil.</p>

<p>Property lost at sea is regulated by different rules. Those
who recover abandoned vessels are entitled to salvage. Property
absolutely lost upon the high seas would seem to belong to the
finder. It has been claimed for the crown, and the American
courts have held, that apart from a decree the finder is only
entitled to salvage rights, the court retaining the rest, and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
practically taking it for the state on the original owner not being
found. The modern English law on the subject of wreck (including
everything found on the shore of the sea or tidal river)
is contained in the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. The finder
must forthwith make known his discovery to the receiver of
wreck under a penalty. He is entitled to a salvage reward, but
the property belongs to the crown or its grantee unless the true
owner claims within a year. In the United States unclaimed wreck
after a year generally becomes the property of the state. In
Scotland the right to lost property is theoretically in the crown,
but the finder would not in practice be interfered with except
under the provisions of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892.
Section 412 requires all persons finding goods to deliver them
forthwith to the police under a penalty. If the true owner is
not discovered within six months the magistrates may hand
them over to the finder. If the owner appears he must pay a
reasonable reward. Domestic animals, including swans, found
straying without an owner may be seized by the crown or lord
of the manor, and if not claimed within a year and a day they
become the property of the crown or the lord, on the observance
of certain formalities. In Scotland they were held to belong to
the crown or its donatory, usually the sheriff of a county. By
the Burgh Police Act above quoted provision is made for the
sale of lost animals and the disposal of the free proceeds for the
purposes of the act unless such be claimed. In the United
States there is diversity of law and custom. Apart from special
rule, lost animals become the property of the finder, but in
many cases the proceeds of their sale are applied to public
purposes. When property is lost by carriers, innkeepers or
railway companies, special provisions as to their respective

<p><span class="bold">LOSTWITHIEL,<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in the
Bodmin parliamentary division of Cornwall, England, 30½ m.
W. of Plymouth by the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901)
1379. It is pleasantly situated on the banks of the river Fowey.
The church of St Bartholomew is remarkable for a fine Early
English tower surmounted by a Decorated spire; there are also
beautiful Decorated windows and details in the body of the
church, and a richly carved octagonal font. A bridge of the
14th century crosses the river. The shire hall includes
remains of a building, called the Stannary prison, dating from
the 13th century. The Great Western railway has workshops
at Lostwithiel.</p>

<p>Lostwithiel owed its ancient liberties&mdash;probably its existence&mdash;to
the neighbouring castle of Restormel. The Pipe Rolls (1194-1203)
show that Robert de Cardinan, lord of Restormel, paid
ten marks yearly for having a market at Lostwithiel. By an
undated charter still preserved with the corporation&rsquo;s muniments
he surrendered to the burgesses all the liberties given them by
his predecessors (<i>antecessores</i>) when they founded the town.
These included hereditary succession to tenements, exemption
from sullage, the right to elect a reeve (<i>praepositus</i>) if the grantor
thought one necessary and the right to marry without the lord&rsquo;s
interference. By Isolda, granddaughter of Robert de Cardinan,
the town was given to Richard, king of the Romans, who in the
third year of his reign granted to the burgesses a gild merchant
sac and soc, toll, team and infangenethef, freedom from pontage,
lastage, &amp;c., throughout Cornwall, and exemption from the
jurisdiction of the hundred and county courts, also a yearly
fair and a weekly market. Richard transferred the assizes from
Launceston to Lostwithiel. His son Edmund, earl of Cornwall,
built a great hall at Lostwithiel and decreed that the coinage
of tin should be at Lostwithiel only. In 1325 Richard&rsquo;s charter
was confirmed and the market ordered to be held on Thursdays.
In 1386 the assizes were transferred back to Launceston. In
1609 a charter of incorporation provided for a mayor, recorder,
six capital burgesses and seventeen assistants and courts of
record and pie powder. The boundaries of the borough were
extended in 1733. Under the reformed charter granted in 1885
the corporation consists of a mayor, four aldermen and twelve
councillors. From 1305 to 1832 two members represented
Lostwithiel in parliament. The electors after 1609 were the
twenty-five members of the corporation. Under the Reform
Act (1832) the borough became merged in the county. For the
Thursday market granted in 1326 a Friday market was substituted
in 1733, and this continues to be held. The fair granted
in 1326 and the three fairs granted in 1733 have all given place
to others. The archdeacon&rsquo;s court, the sessions and the county
elections were long held at Lostwithiel, but all have now been
removed. For the victory gained by Charles I. over the earl of
Essex in 1644, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Great Rebellion</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOT,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> in the Bible, the legendary ancestor of the two Palestinian
peoples, Moab and Ammon (Gen. xix. 30-38; cp. Ps. lxxxiii. 8);
he appears to have been represented as a Horite or Edomite
(cp. the name Lotan, Gen. xxxvi. 20, 22). As the son of Haran
and grandson of Terah, he was Abraham&rsquo;s nephew (Gen. xi. 31),
and he accompanied his uncle in his migration from Haran to
Canaan. Near Bethel<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Lot separated from Abraham, owing to
disputes between their shepherds, and being offered the first
choice, chose the rich fields of the Jordan valley which were as
fertile and well irrigated as the &ldquo;garden of Yahweh&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Eden,
Gen. xiii. 7 sqq.). It was in this district that the cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah were situated. He was saved from their fate
by two divine messengers who spent the night in his house, and
next morning led Lot, his wife, and his two unmarried daughters
out of the city. His wife looked back and was changed to a
pillar of salt,<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a> but Lot with his two daughters escaped first to
Zoar and then to the mountains east of the Dead Sea, where the
daughters planned and executed an incest by which they became
the mothers of Moab and Ben-Ammi (<i>i.e.</i> Ammon; Gen. xix.).
The account of Chedorlaomer&rsquo;s invasion and of Lot&rsquo;s rescue by
Abraham belongs to an independent source (Gen. xiv.), the age
and historical value of which has been much disputed. (See
further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abraham</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Melchizedek</a></span>.) Lot&rsquo;s character is made
to stand in strong contrast with that of Abraham, notably in the
representation of his selfishness (xiii. 5 sqq.), and reluctance to
leave the sinful city (xix. 16 sqq.); relatively, however, he was
superior to the rest (with the crude story of his insistence upon
the inviolable rights of guests, xix. 5 sqq.; cf. Judges xix. 22 sqq.),
and is regarded in 2 Pet. ii. 7 seq. as a type of righteousness.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lot and his daughters passed into Arabic tradition from the Jews.
The daughters are named Zahy and Ra&rsquo;wa by Mas&rsquo;&#363;d&#299; ii. 139; but
other Arabian writers give other forms. Paton (<i>Syria and Palestine</i>,
pp. 43, 123) identifies Lot-Lotan with <i>Ruten</i>, one of the Egyptian
names for Palestine; its true meaning is obscure. For traces of
mythical elements in the story see Winckler, <i>Altorient. Forsch.</i> ii.

<p><span class="bold">LOT<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (Lat. <i>Oltis</i>), a river of southern France flowing westward
across the central plateau, through the departments of Lozère,
Aveyron, Lot and Lot-et-Garonne. Its length is about 300 m.,
the area of its basin 4444 sq. m. The river rises in the Cévennes
on the Mont du Goulet at a height of 4918 ft. about 15 m. E.
of Mende, past which it flows. Its upper course lies through
gorges between the Causse of Mende and Aubrac Mountains
on the north and the tablelands (<i>causses</i>) of Sauveterre, Severac
and Comtal on the south. Thence its sinuous course crosses
the plateau of Quercy and entering a wider fertile plain flows
into the Garonne at Aiguillon between Agen and Marmande.
Its largest tributary, the Truyère, rises in the Margeride mountains
and after a circuitous course joins it on the right at
Entraygues (department of Aveyron), its affluence more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
doubling the volume of the river. Lower down it receives
the Dourdou de Bozouls (or du Nord) on the left and on the right
the Célé above Cahors (department of Lot), which is situated
on a peninsula skirted by one of the river&rsquo;s many windings.
Villeneuve-sur-Lot (department of Lot-et-Garonne) is the
only town of any importance between this point and its mouth.
The Lot is canalized between Bouquiès, above which there is no
navigation, and the Garonne (160 m.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOT,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> a department of south-western France, formed in 1790
from the district of Quercy, part of the old province of Guyenne.
It is bounded N. by Corrèze, W. by Dordogne and Lot-et-Garonne,
S. by Tarn-et-Garonne, and E. by Aveyron and Cantal. Area
2017 sq. m. Pop. (1906) 216,611. The department extends
over the western portion of the Massif Central of France; it
slopes towards the south-west, and has a maximum altitude
of 2560 ft. on the borders of Cantal with a minimum of 213 ft.
at the point where the river Lot quits the department. The Lot,
which traverses it from east to west, is navigable for the whole
distance (106 m.) with the help of locks; its principal tributary
within the department is the Célé (on the right). In the north
of the department the Dordogne has a course of 37 m.; among
its tributaries are the Cère, which has its rise in Cantal, and the
Ouysse, a river of no great length, but remarkable for the
abundance of its waters. The streams in the south of Lot all
flow into the Tarn. The eastern and western portions of the
department are covered by ranges of hills; the north, the centre,
and part of the south are occupied by a belt of limestone plateaus
or <i>causses</i>, that to the north of the Dordogne is called the Causse
de Martel; between the Dordogne and the Lot is the Causse
de Gramat or de Rocamadour; south of the Lot is the Causse
de Cahors. The <i>causses</i> are for the most part bare and arid
owing to the rapid disappearance of the rain in clefts and chasms
in the limestone, which are known as <i>igues</i>. These are most
numerous in the Causse de Gramat and are sometimes of great
beauty; the best known is the Gouffre de Padirac, 7 m. N.E.
of Rocamadour. The altitude of the <i>causses</i> (from 700 to 1300 ft.,
much lower than that of the similar plateaus in Lozère, Hérault
and Aveyron) permits the cultivation of the vine; they also
yield a small quantity of cereals and potatoes and some wood.
The deep intervening valleys are full of verdure, being well
watered by abundant springs. The climate is on the whole that
of the Girondine region; the valleys are warm, and the rainfall
is somewhat above the average for France. The difference of
temperature between the higher parts of the department belonging
to the central plateau and the sheltered valleys of the
south-west is considerable. Wheat, maize, oats and rye are the
chief cereals. Wine is the principal product, the most valued
being that of Cahors grown in the valley of the Lot, which is,
in general, the most productive portion of the department.
It is used partly for blending with other wines and partly for
local consumption. The north-east cantons produce large
quantities of chestnuts; walnuts, apples and plums are common,
and the department also grows potatoes and tobacco and
supplies truffles. Sheep are the most abundant kind of live
stock; but pigs, horned cattle, horses, asses, mules and goats
are also reared, as well as poultry and bees. Iron and coal are
mined, and there are important zinc deposits (Planioles). Limestone
is quarried. There are oil-works and numerous mills, and
wool spinning and carding as well as cloth making, tanning,
currying, brewing and the making of agricultural implements
are carried on to some extent. The three arrondissements are
those of Cahors, the capital, Figeac and Gourdon; there are
29 cantons and 329 communes.</p>

<p>Lot belongs to the 17th military district, and to the <i>académie</i>
of Toulouse, and falls within the circumscription of the court
of appeal at Agen, and the province of the archbishop of Albi.
It is served by the Orleans railway. Cahors, Figeac and Rocamadour
are the principal places. Of the interesting churches
and châteaux of the department, may be mentioned the fine
feudal fortress at Castelnau occupying a commanding natural
position, with an audience hall of the 12th century, and the
Romanesque abbey-church at Souillac with fine sculpturing
on the principal entrance. The plateau of Puy d&rsquo;Issolu, near
Vayrac, is believed by most authorities to be the site of the
ancient Uxcellodunum, the scene of the last stand of the Gauls
against Julius Caesar in 51 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Lot has many dolmens, the
finest being that of Pierre Martine, near Livernon (arr. of
Figeac).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOT-ET-GARONNE,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> a department of south-western France,
formed in 1790 of Agenais and Bazadais, two districts of the
old province of Guienne, and of Condomois, Lomagne, Brullois
and pays d&rsquo;Albret, formerly portions of Gascony. It is bounded
W. by Gironde, N. by Dordogne, E. by Lot and Tarn-et-Garonne,
S. by Gers and S.W. by Landes. Area 2079 sq. m. Pop. (1906)
274,610. The Garonne, which traverses the department from
S.E. to N.W., divides it into two unequal parts. That to the
north is a country of hills and deep ravines, and the slope is
from east to west, while in the region to the south, which is a
continuation of the plateau of Lannemezan and Armagnac, the
slope is directly from south to north. A small portion in the
south-west belongs to the sterile region of the Landes (<i>q.v.</i>);
the broad valleys of the Garonne and of its affluent the Lot are
proverbial for their fertility. The wildest part is towards the
north-east on the borders of Dordogne, where a region of <i>causses</i>
(limestone plateaus) and forests begins; the highest point
(896 ft.) is also found here. The Garonne, where it quits the
department, is only some 20 ft. above the sea-level; it is navigable
throughout, with the help of its lateral canal, as also are the
Lot and Baise with the help of locks. The Drot, a right affluent
of the Garonne in the north of the department, is also navigable
in the lower part of its course. The climate is that of the
Girondine region&mdash;mild and fine&mdash;the mean temperature of
Agen being 56.6° Fahr., or 5° above that of Paris; the annual
rainfall, which, in the plain of Agen, varies from 20 to 24 in., is
nearly the least in France. Agriculturally the department is
one of the richest. Of cereals wheat is the chief, maize and oats
coming next. Potatoes, vines and tobacco are important
sources of wealth. The best wines are those of Clairac and
Buzet. Vegetable and fruit-growing are prosperous. Plum-trees
(<i>pruniers d&rsquo;ente</i>) are much cultivated in the valleys of the Garonne
and Lot, and the apricots of Nicole and Tonneins are well known.
The chief trees are the pine and the oak; the cork-oak flourishes
in the Landes, and poplars and willows are abundant on the
borders of the Garonne. Horned cattle, chiefly of the Garonne
breed, are the principal live stock. Poultry and pigs are also
reared profitably. There are deposits of iron in the department.
The forges, blast furnaces and foundries of Fumel are important;
and agricultural implements and other machines are manufactured.
The making of lime and cement, of tiles, bricks and
pottery, of confectionery and dried plums (pruneaux d&rsquo;Agen)
and other delicacies, and brewing and distilling, occupy many
of the inhabitants. At Tonneins (pop. 4691 in 1906) there is a
national tobacco manufactory. Cork cutting, of which the
centre is Mézin, hat and candle making, wool spinning, weaving
of woollen and cotton stuffs, tanning, paper-making, oil-making,
dyeing and flour and saw-milling are other prominent industries.
The peasants still speak the Gascon patois. The arrondissements
are 4&mdash;Agen, Marmande, Nérac and Villeneuve-sur-Lot&mdash;and
there are 35 cantons and 326 communes.</p>

<p>Agen, the capital, is the seat of a bishopric and of the court
of appeal for the department of Lot-et-Garonne. The department
belongs to the region of the XVII. army corps, the <i>académie</i>
of Bordeaux, and the province of the archbishop of Bordeaux.
Lot-et-Garonne is served by the lines of the Southern and the
Orleans railways, its rivers afford about 160 m. of navigable
waterway, and the lateral canal of the Garonne traverses it for
54 m. Agen, Marmande, Nérac and Villeneuve-sur-Lot, the
principal places, are treated under separate headings. The
department possesses Roman remains at Mas d&rsquo;Agenais and at
Aiguillon. The churches of Layrac, Monsempron, Mas d&rsquo;Agenais,
Moirax, Mézin and Vianne are of interest, as also are the fortifications
of Vianne of the 13th century, and the châteaux of
Xaintrailles, Bonaguil, Gavaudun and of the industrial town
of Casteljaloux.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTHAIR I.<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (795-855), Roman emperor, was the eldest son
of the emperor Louis I., and his wife Irmengarde. Little is
known of his early life, which was probably passed at the court
of his grandfather Charlemagne, until 815 when he became
ruler of Bavaria. When Louis in 817 divided the Empire between
his sons, Lothair was crowned joint emperor at Aix-la-Chapelle
and given a certain superiority over his brothers. In 821 he
married Irmengarde (d. 851), daughter of Hugo, count of Tours;
in 822 undertook the government of Italy; and, on the 5th of
April 823, was crowned emperor by Pope Paschal I. at Rome.
In November 824 he promulgated a statute concerning the
relations of pope and emperor which reserved the supreme
power to the secular potentate, and he afterwards issued various
ordinances for the good government of Italy. On his return to
his father&rsquo;s court his stepmother Judith won his consent to her
plan for securing a kingdom for her son Charles, a scheme which
was carried out in 829. Lothair, however, soon changed his
attitude, and spent the succeeding decade in constant strife
over the division of the Empire with his father. He was <span class="correction" title="amended from alternetely">alternately</span>
master of the Empire, and banished and confined to Italy;
at one time taking up arms in alliance with his brothers and
at another fighting against them; whilst the bounds of his
appointed kingdom were in turn extended and reduced. When
Louis was dying in 840, he sent the imperial <i>insignia</i> to Lothair,
who, disregarding the various partitions, claimed the whole
of the Empire. Negotiations with his brother Louis and his
half-brother Charles, both of whom armed to resist this claim,
were followed by an alliance of the younger brothers against
Lothair. A decisive battle was fought at Fontenoy on the 25th
of June 841, when, in spite of his personal gallantry, Lothair
was defeated and fled to Aix. With fresh troops he entered
upon a war of plunder, but the forces of his brothers were too
strong for him, and taking with him such treasure as he could
collect, he abandoned to them his capital. Efforts to make
peace were begun, and in June 842 the brothers met on an
island in the Sâone, and agreed to an arrangement which
developed, after much difficulty and delay, into the treaty of
Verdun signed in August 843. By this Lothair received Italy
and the imperial title, together with a stretch of land between
the North and Mediterranean Seas lying along the valleys of
the Rhine and the Rhone. He soon abandoned Italy to his
eldest son, Louis, and remained in his new kingdom, engaged
in alternate quarrels and reconciliations with his brothers, and
in futile efforts to defend his lands from the attacks of the
Normans and the Saracens. In 855 he became seriously ill,
and despairing of recovery renounced the throne, divided his
lands between his three sons, and on the 23rd of September
entered the monastery of Prüm, where he died six days later.
He was buried at Prüm, where his remains were found in 1860.
Lothair was entirely untrustworthy and quite unable to maintain
either the unity or the dignity of the empire of Charlemagne.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTHAIR II.<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> or <span class="bold">III.</span> (<i>c.</i> 1070-1137), surnamed the &ldquo;Saxon,&rdquo;
Roman emperor, son of Gebhard, count of Supplinburg, belonged
to a family possessing extensive lands around Helmstadt in
Saxony, to which he succeeded on his father&rsquo;s death in 1075.
Gebhard had been a leading opponent of the emperor Henry IV.
in Saxony, and his son, taking the same attitude, assisted
Egbert II., margrave of Meissen, in the rising of 1088. The
position and influence of Lothair in Saxony, already considerable,
was increased when in 1100 he married Richenza, daughter of
Henry, count of Nordheim, who became an heiress on her father&rsquo;s
death in 1101, and inherited other estates when her brother
Otto died childless in 1116. Having assisted the German king,
Henry V., against his father in 1104, Lothair was appointed
duke of Saxony by Henry, when Duke Magnus, the last of the
Billungs, died in 1106. His first care was to establish his
authority over some districts east of the Elbe; and quickly
making himself independent of the king, he stood forth as the
representative of the Saxon race. This attitude brought him
into collision with Henry V., to whom, however, he was forced
to submit after an unsuccessful rising in 1112. A second rising
was caused when, on the death of Ulrich II., count of Weimar
and Orlamünde, without issue in 1112, Henry seized these
counties as vacant fiefs of the empire, while Lothair supported
the claim of Siegfried, count of Ballenstädt, whose mother was
a relative of Ulrich. The rebels were defeated, and Siegfried
was killed at Warnstädt in 1113, but his son secured possession
of the disputed counties. After the defeat by Lothair of Henry&rsquo;s
forces at Welfesholz on the 11th of February 1115, events called
Henry to Italy; and Lothair appears to have been undisturbed
in Saxony until 1123, when the death of Henry II., margrave of
Meissen and Lusatia raised a dispute as to the right of appointment
to the vacant margraviates. A struggle ensued, in which
victory remained with the duke. The Saxony policy of Lothair
during these years had been to make himself independent, and
to extend his authority; to this end he allied himself with the
papal party, and easily revived the traditional hostility of the
Saxons to the Franconian emperors.</p>

<p>When Henry V. died in 1125, Lothair, after a protracted
election, was chosen German king at Mainz on the 30th of August
1125. His election was largely owing to the efforts of Adalbert,
archbishop of Mainz, and the papal party, who disliked the
candidature of Henry&rsquo;s nephew and heir, Frederick II. of
Hohenstaufen, duke of Swabia. The new king was crowned at
Aix-la-Chapelle on the 13th of September 1125. Before suffering
a severe reverse, brought about by his interference in the internal
affairs of Bohemia, Lothair requested Frederick of Hohenstaufen
to restore to the crown the estates bequeathed to him by the
emperor Henry V. Frederick refused, and was placed under the
ban. Lothair, unable to capture Nüremberg, gained the support
of Henry the Proud, the new duke of Bavaria, by giving him his
daughter, Gertrude, in marriage, and that of Conrad, count of
Zähringen, by granting him the administration of the kingdom
of Burgundy, or Arles. As a counterstroke, however, Conrad
of Hohenstaufen, the brother of Frederick, was chosen German
king in December 1127, and was quickly recognized in northern
Italy. But Lothair gained the upper hand in Germany, and by
the end of 1129 the Hohenstaufen strongholds, Nüremberg and
Spires, were in his possession. This struggle was accompanied
by disturbances in Lorraine, Saxony and Thuringia, but order
was soon restored after the resistance of the Hohenstaufen
had been beaten down. In 1131 the king led an expedition
into Denmark, where one of his vassals had been murdered
by Magnus, son of the Danish king, Niels, and where general
confusion reigned; but no resistance was offered, and Niels
promised to pay tribute to Lothair.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s attention at the time was called to Italy where
two popes, Innocent II. and Anacletus II., were clamouring
for his support. At first Lothair, fully occupied with the affairs
of Germany, remained heedless and neutral; but in March
1131 he was visited at Liége by Innocent, to whom he promised
his assistance. Crossing the Alps with a small army in September
1132, he reached Rome in March 1133, accompanied by Innocent.
As St Peter&rsquo;s was held by Anacletus, Lothair&rsquo;s coronation as
emperor took place on the 4th of June 1133 in the church of
the Lateran. He then received as papal fiefs the vast estates
of Matilda, marchioness of Tuscany, thus securing for his
daughter and her Welf husband lands which might otherwise
have passed to the Hohenstaufen. His efforts to continue the
investiture controversy were not very serious. He returned to
Germany, where he restored order in Bavaria, and made an
expedition against some rebels in the regions of the lower Rhine.
Resuming the struggle against the Hohenstaufen, Lothair
soon obtained the submission of the brothers, who retained their
lands, and a general peace was sworn at Bamberg. The emperor&rsquo;s
authority was now generally recognized, and the annalists speak
highly of the peace and order of his later years. In 1135, Eric II.,
king of Denmark, acknowledged himself a vassal of Lothair;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
Boleslaus III., prince of the Poles, promised tribute and received
Pomerania and Rügen as German fiefs; while the eastern
emperor, John Comnenus, implored Lothair&rsquo;s aid against
Roger II. of Sicily.</p>

<p>The emperor seconded the efforts of his vassals, Albert the
Bear, margrave of the Saxon north mark, and Conrad I., margrave
of Meissen and Lusatia, to extend the authority of the Germans
in the districts east of the Elbe, and assisted Norbert, archbishop
of Magdeburg, and Albert I., archbishop of Bremen, to spread
Christianity. In August 1136, attended by a large army, Lothair
set out upon his second Italian journey. The Lombard cities
were either terrified into submission or taken by storm; Roger II.
was driven from Apulia; and the imperial power enforced
over the whole of southern Italy. A mutiny among the German
soldiers and a breach with Innocent concerning the overlordship
of Apulia compelled the emperor to retrace his steps. An
arrangement was made with regard to Apulia, after which
Lothair, returning to Germany, died at Breitenwang, a village
in the Tirol, on the 3rd or 4th of December 1137. His body was
carried to Saxony and buried in the monastery which he had
founded at Königslutter. Lothair was a strong and capable
ruler, who has been described as the &ldquo;imitator and heir of the
first Otto.&rdquo; Contemporaries praise his justice and his virtue,
and his reign was regarded, especially by Saxons and churchmen,
as a golden age for Germany.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTHAIR<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (941-986), king of France, son of Louis IV., succeeded
his father in 954, and was at first under the guardianship
of Hugh the Great, duke of the Franks, and then under that of
his maternal uncle Bruno, archbishop of Cologne. The beginning
of his reign was occupied with wars against the vassals, particularly
against the duke of Normandy. Lothair then seems to
have conceived the design of recovering Lorraine. He attempted
to precipitate matters by a sudden attack, and in the spring
of 978 nearly captured the emperor Otto II. at Aix-la-Chapelle.
Otto took his revenge in the autumn by invading France. He
penetrated as far as Paris, devastating the country through
which he passed, but failed to take the town, and was forced
to retreat with heavy loss. Peace was concluded in 980 at
Margut-sur-Chiers, and in 983 Lothair was even chosen guardian
to the young Otto III. Towards 980, however, Lothair quarrelled
with Hugh the Great&rsquo;s son, Hugh Capet, who, at the instigation
of Adalberon, archbishop of Reims, became reconciled with
Otto III. Lothair died on the 2nd of March 986. By his wife
Emma, daughter of Lothair, king of Italy, he left a son who
succeeded him as Louis V.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTHAIR<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (825-869), king of the district called after him
Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was the second son of the emperor
Lothair I. On his father&rsquo;s death in 855, he received for his
kingdom a district lying west of the Rhine, between the North
Sea and the Jura mountains, which was called <i>Regnum Lotharii</i>
and early in the 10th century became known as Lotharingia
or Lorraine. On the death of his brother Charles in 863 he added
some lands south of the Jura to this inheritance, but, except
for a few feeble expeditions against the Danish pirates, he seems
to have done little for its government or its defence. The
reign was chiefly occupied by efforts on the part of Lothair
to obtain a divorce from his wife Teutberga, a sister of Hucbert,
abbot of St Maurice (d. 864); and his relations with his uncles,
Charles the Bald and Louis the German, were influenced by his
desire to obtain their support to this plan. Although quarrels
and reconciliations between the three kings followed each other
in quick succession, in general it may be said that Louis favoured
the divorce, and Charles opposed it, while neither lost sight of the
fact that Lothair was without male issue. Lothair, whose desire
for the divorce was prompted by his affection for a certain
Waldrada, put away Teutberga; but Hucbert took up arms
on her behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the
ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858.
Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother,
the emperor Louis II., by a cession of lands, and obtained the
consent of the local clergy to the divorce and to his marriage
with Waldrada, which was celebrated in 862. A synod of
Frankish bishops met at Metz in 863 and confirmed this decision,
but Teutberga fled to the court of Charles the Bald, and Pope
Nicholas I. declared against the decision of the synod. An
attack on Rome by the emperor was without result, and in
865 Lothair, convinced that Louis and Charles at their recent
meeting had discussed the partition of his kingdom, and
threatened with excommunication, again took back his wife.
Teutberga, however, either from inclination or compulsion,
now expressed her desire for a divorce, and Lothair went to
Italy to obtain the assent of the new pope Adrian II. Placing
a favourable interpretation upon the words of the pope, he had
set out on the return journey, when he was seized with fever
and died at Piacenza on the 8th of August 869. He left, by
Waldrada, a son Hugo who was declared illegitimate, and his
kingdom was divided between Charles the Bald and Louis
the German.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTHIAN, EARLS AND MARQUESSES OF.<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> <span class="sc">Mark Kerr</span>,
1st earl of Lothian (d. 1609), was the eldest son of Mark Kerr
(d. 1584), abbot, and then commendator, of Newbattle, or
Newbottle, and was a member of the famous border family of
Ker of Cessford. The earls and dukes of Roxburghe, who are
also descended from the Kers of Cessford, have adopted the
spelling Ker, while the earls and marquesses of Lothian have
taken the form Kerr. Like his father, the abbot of Newbattle,
Mark Kerr was an extraordinary lord of session under the
Scottish king James VI.; he became Lord Newbattle in 1587
and was created earl of Lothian in 1606. He was master of
inquests from 1577 to 1606, and he died on the 8th of April
1609, having had, as report says, thirty-one children by his wife,
Margaret (d. 1617), daughter of John Maxwell, 4th Lord Herries.
His son Robert, the 2nd earl, died without sons in July 1624.
He had, in 1621, obtained a charter from the king enabling his
daughter Anne to succeed to his estates provided that she
married a member of the family of Ker. Consequently in 1631
she married William Ker, son of Robert, 1st earl of Ancrum
(1578-1654), a member of the family of Ker of Ferniehurst,
whose father, William Ker, had been killed in 1590 by Robert
Ker, afterwards 1st earl of Roxburghe. Robert was in attendance
upon Charles I. both before and after he came to the
throne, and was created earl of Ancrum in 1633. He was a
writer and a man of culture, and among his friends were the poet
Donne and Drummond of Hawthornden. His elder son William
was created earl of Lothian in 1631, the year of his marriage with
Anne Kerr, and Sir William Kerr of Blackhope, a brother of the
2nd earl, who had taken the title of earl of Lothian in 1624, was
forbidden to use it (see <i>Correspondence of Sir Robert Ker, earl of
Ancrum, and his son William, third earl of Lothian</i>, 1875).</p>

<p><span class="sc">William Ker</span> (<i>c.</i> 1605-1675), who thus became 3rd earl of
Lothian, signed the Scottish national covenant in 1638 and
marched with the Scots into England in 1640, being present when
the English were routed at Newburn, after which he became
governor of Newcastle-on-Tyne. During the Civil War he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
prominent rather as a politician than as a soldier; he became
a Scottish secretary of state in 1649, and was one of the commissioners
who visited Charles II. at Breda in 1650. He died
at Newbattle Abbey, near Edinburgh, in October 1675. William&rsquo;s
eldest son Robert, the 4th earl (1636-1703), supported the Revolution
of 1688 and served William III. in several capacities; he
became 3rd earl of Ancrum on the death of his uncle Charles
in 1690, and was created marquess of Lothian in 1701. His
eldest son William, the 2nd marquess (<i>c.</i> 1662-1722), who had
been a Scottish peer as Lord Jedburgh since 1692, was a supporter
of the union with England. His son William, the 3rd marquess
(<i>c.</i> 1690-1767), was the father of William Henry, the 4th marquess,
who was wounded at Fontenoy and was present at Culloden.
He was a member of parliament for some years and had reached
the rank of general in the army when he died at Bath on the 12th
of April 1775. His grandson William, the 6th marquess (1763-1824),
married Henrietta (1762-1805), daughter and heiress of
John Hobart, 2nd earl of Buckinghamshire, thus bringing
Blickling Hall and the Norfolk estates of the Hobarts into the
Kerr family. In 1821 he was created a peer of the United
Kingdom as Baron Ker and he died on the 27th of April 1824.
In 1900 Robert Schomberg Kerr (b. 1874) succeeded his father,
Schomberg Henry, the 9th marquess (1833-1900), as 10th
marquess of Lothian.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTHIAN.<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> This name was formerly applied to a considerably
larger extent of country than the three counties of Linlithgow,
Edinburgh and Haddington. Roxburghshire and Berwickshire
at all events were included in it, probably also the upper part of
Tweeddale (at least Selkirk). It would thus embrace the
eastern part of the Lowlands from the Forth to the Cheviots,
<i>i.e.</i> all the English part of Scotland in the 11th century. This
region formed from the 7th century onward part of the kingdoms
of Bernicia and Northumbria, though we have no definite information
as to the date or events by which it came into English
hands. In Roman times, according to Ptolemy, it was occupied
by a people called Otadini, whose name is thought to have been
preserved in Manaw Gododin, the home of the British king
Cunedda before he migrated to North Wales. There is no reason
to doubt that the district remained in Welsh hands until towards
the close of the 6th century; for in the <i>Historia Brittonum</i> the
Bernician king Theodoric, whose traditional date is 572-579, is
said to have been engaged in war with four Welsh kings. One
of these was Rhydderch Hen who, as we know from Adamnan,
reigned at Dumbarton, while another named Urien is said to
have besieged Theodoric in Lindisfarne. If this statement is
to be believed it is hardly likely that the English had by this
time obtained a firm footing beyond the Tweed. At all events
there can be little doubt that the whole region was conquered
within the next fifty years. Most probably the greater part of
it was conquered by the Northumbrian king Æthelfrith, who,
according to Bede, ravaged the territory of the Britons more
often than any other English king, in some places reducing the
natives to dependence, in others exterminating them and
replacing them by English settlers.</p>

<p>In the time of Oswic the English element became predominant
in northern Britain. His supremacy was acknowledged both
by the Welsh in the western Lowlands and by the Scots in
Argyllshire. On the death of the Pictish king Talorgan, the son
of his brother Eanfrith, he seems to have obtained the sovereignty
over a considerable part of that nation also. Early in Ecgfrith&rsquo;s
reign an attempt at revolt on the part of the Picts proved unsuccessful.
We hear at this time also of the establishment of an
English bishopric at Abercorn, which, however, only lasted for
a few years. By the disastrous overthrow of Ecgfrith in 685
the Picts, Scots and some of the Britons also recovered their
independence. Yet we find a succession of English bishops at
Whithorn from 730 to the 9th century, from which it may be
inferred that the south-west coast had already by this time
become English. The Northumbrian dominions were again
enlarged by Eadberht, who in 750 is said to have annexed Kyle,
the central part of Ayrshire, with other districts. In conjunction
with &OElig;ngus mac Fergus, king of the Picts, he also reduced the
whole of the Britons to submission in 756. But this subjugation
was not lasting, and the British kingdom, though now reduced
to the basin of the Clyde, whence its inhabitants are known as
Strathclyde Britons, continued to exist for nearly three centuries.
After Eadberht&rsquo;s time we hear little of events in the northern part
of Northumbria, and there is some reason for suspecting that
English influence in the south-west began to decline before
long, as our list of bishops of Whithorn ceases early in the 9th
century; the evidence on this point, however, is not so decisive
as is commonly stated. About 844 an important revolution
took place among the Picts. The throne was acquired by
Kenneth mac Alpin, a prince of Scottish family, who soon became
formidable to the Northumbrians. He is said to have invaded
&ldquo;Saxonia&rdquo; six times, and to have burnt Dunbar and Melrose.
After the disastrous battle at York in 867 the Northumbrians
were weakened by the loss of the southern part of their territories,
and between 883 and 889 the whole country as far as Lindisfarne
was ravaged by the Scots. In 919, however, we find their leader
Aldred calling in Constantine II., king of the Scots, to help them.
A few years later together with Constantine and the Britons they
acknowledged the supremacy of Edward the Elder. After his
death, however, both the Scots and the Britons were for a time
in alliance with the Norwegians from Ireland, and consequently
Æthelstan is said to have ravaged a large portion of the Scottish
king&rsquo;s territories in 934. Brunanburh, where Æthelstan defeated
the confederates in 937, is believed by many to have been in
Dumfriesshire, but we have no information as to the effects
of the battle on the northern populations. By this time, however,
the influence of the Scottish kingdom certainly seems to
have increased in the south, and in 945 the English king Edmund
gave Cumberland, <i>i.e.</i> apparently the British kingdom of Strathclyde,
to Malcolm I., king of the Scots, in consideration of his
alliance with him. Malcolm&rsquo;s successor Indulph (954-962)
succeeded in capturing Edinburgh, which thenceforth remained
in possession of the Scots. His successors made repeated attempts
to extend their territory southwards, and certain late chroniclers
state that Kenneth II. in 971-975 obtained a grant of the whole
of Lothian from Edgar. Whatever truth this story may contain,
the cession of the province was finally effected by Malcolm II.
by force of arms. At his first attempt in 1006 he seems to have
suffered a great defeat from Uhtred, the son of earl Waltheof.
Twelve years later, however, he succeeded in conjunction with
Eugenius, king of Strathclyde, in annihilating the Northumbrian
army at Carham on the Tweed, and Eadulf Cudel, the brother
and successor of Uhtred, ceded all his territory to the north of
that river as the price of peace. Henceforth in spite of an invasion
by Aldred, the son of Uhtred, during the reign of Duncan,
Lothian remained permanently in possession of the Scottish
kings. In the reign of Malcolm III. and his son, the English
element appears to have acquired considerable influence in the
kingdom. Some three years before he obtained his father&rsquo;s
throne Malcolm had by the help of earl Siward secured the
government of Cumbria (Strathclyde) with which Lothian
was probably united. Then in 1068 he received a large number
of exiles from England, amongst them the Ætheling Eadgar,
whose sister Margaret he married. Four other sons in succession
occupied the throne, and in the time of the youngest, David,
who held most of the south of Scotland as an earldom from
1107-1124 and the whole kingdom from 1124-1153, the court
seems already to have been composed chiefly of English and
Normans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTI, PIERRE<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> [the pen-name of <span class="sc">Louis Marie Julien
Viaud</span>] (1850-&emsp;&emsp;), French author, was born at Rochefort on
the 14th of January 1850. The Viauds are an old Protestant
family, and Pierre Loti consistently adhered, at least nominally,
to the faith of his fathers. Of the picturesque and touching
incidents of his childhood he has given a very vivid account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
in <i>Le Roman d&rsquo;un enfant</i> (1890). His education began in Rochefort,
but at the age of seventeen, being destined for the navy,
he entered the naval school, Le Borda, and gradually rose in his
profession, attaining the rank of captain in 1906. In January
1910 he was placed on the reserve list. His pseudonym is said
to be due to his extreme shyness and reserve in early life, which
made his comrades call him after <i>le Loti</i>, an Indian flower which
loves to blush unseen. He was never given to books or study
(when he was received at the French Academy, he had the courage
to say, &ldquo;Loti ne sait pas lire&rdquo;), and it was not until 1876 that
he was persuaded to write down and publish some curious
experiences at Constantinople, in <i>Aziyadé</i>, a book which, like
so many of Loti&rsquo;s, seems half a romance, half an autobiography.
He proceeded to the South Seas, and on leaving Tahiti published
the Polynesian <span class="correction" title="amended from idyl">idyll</span>, originally called <i>Rarahu</i> (1880), which
was reprinted as <i>Le Mariage de Loti</i>, and which first introduced
to the wider public an author of remarkable originality and
charm. <i>Le Roman d&rsquo;un spahi</i>, a record of the melancholy
adventures of a soldier in Senegambia, belongs to 1881. In 1882
Loti issued a collection of short studies under the general title
of <i>Fleurs d&rsquo;ennui</i>. In 1883 he achieved the widest celebrity,
for not only did he publish <i>Mon frère Yves</i>, a novel describing
the life of a French bluejacket in all parts of the world&mdash;perhaps
his most characteristic production&mdash;but he was involved in a
public discussion in a manner which did him great credit. While
taking part as a naval officer in the Tongking War, Loti had
exposed in the <i>Figaro</i> a series of scandals which followed on the
capture of Hué (1883), and was suspended from the service
for more than a year. He continued for some time nearly silent,
but in 1886 he published a novel of life among the Breton fisher-folk,
called <i>Pêcheur d&rsquo;islande</i>, the most popular of all his writings.
In 1887 he brought out a volume of extraordinary merit, which
has not received the attention it deserves; this is <i>Propos d&rsquo;exil</i>,
a series of short studies of exotic places, in his peculiar semi-autobiographic
style. The fantastic novel of Japanese manners,
<i>Madame Chrysanthème</i>, belongs to the same year. Passing over
one or two slighter productions, we come in 1890 to <i>Au Maroc</i>, the
record of a journey to Fez in company with a French embassy. A
collection of strangely confidential and sentimental reminiscences,
called <i>Le Livre de la pitié et de la mort</i>, belongs to 1891. Loti
was on board his ship at the port of Algiers when news was
brought to him of his election, on the 21st of May 1891, to the
French Academy. In 1892 he published <i>Fantôme d&rsquo;orient</i>,
another dreamy study of life in Constantinople, a sort of continuation
of <i>Aziyadé</i>. He described a visit to the Holy Land,
somewhat too copiously, in three volumes (1895-1896), and
wrote a novel, <i>Ramuntcho</i> (1897), a story of manners in the
Basque province, which is equal to his best writings. In 1900
he visited British India, with the view of describing what he saw;
the result appeared in 1903&mdash;<i>L&rsquo;Inde</i> (<i>sans les Anglais</i>). At his
best Pierre Loti was unquestionably the finest descriptive writer
of the day. In the delicate exactitude with which he reproduced
the impression given to his own alert nerves by unfamiliar forms,
colours, sounds and perfumes, he was without a rival. But he
was not satisfied with this exterior charm; he desired to blend
with it a moral sensibility of the extremest refinement, at once
sensual and ethereal. Many of his best books are long sobs
of remorseful memory, so personal, so intimate, that an English
reader is amazed to find such depth of feeling compatible with
the power of minutely and publicly recording what is felt.
In spite of the beauty and melody and fragrance of Loti&rsquo;s books
his mannerisms are apt to pall upon the reader, and his later books
of pure description were rather empty. His greatest successes
were gained in the species of confession, half-way between fact
and fiction, which he essayed in his earlier books. When all his
limitations, however, have been rehearsed, Pierre Loti remains,
in the mechanism of style and cadence, one of the most original
and most perfect French writers of the second half of the 19th
century. Among his later works were: <i>La Troisième jeunesse de
Mme Prune</i> (1905); <i>Les Désenchantées</i> (1906, Eng. trans. by
C. Bell); <i>La Mort de Philae</i> (1908); <i>Judith Renaudin</i> (Théâtre
Antoine, 1904), a five-act historical play based on an earlier
book; and, in collaboration with Émile Vedel, a translation of
<i>King Lear</i>, also produced at the Théâtre Antoine in 1904.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÖTSCHEN PASS,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lötschberg</span>, an easy glacier pass
(8842 ft.) leading from Kandersteg in the Bernese Oberland to
the Lötschen valley in the Valais. It is a very old pass, first
mentioned distinctly in 1352, but probably crossed previously
by the Valaisans who colonized various parts of the Bernese
Oberland. In 1384 and again in 1419 battles were fought on
it between the Bernese and the Valaisans, while in 1698 a mule
path (of which traces still exist) was constructed on the Bernese
slope, though not continued beyond owing to the fear of the
Valaisans that the Bernese would come over and alter their
religion. In 1906 the piercing of a tunnel (8½ m. long) beneath
this pass was begun, starting a little above Kandersteg and
ending at Goppenstein near the mouth of the Lötschen valley.
Subsidies were granted by both the confederation and the canton
of Bern. This pass is to be carefully distinguished from the
Lötschenlücke (10,512 ft.), another easy glacier pass which leads
from the head of the Lötschen valley to the Great Aletsch

by some of the emperors. Nero gave such prizes as a house or
a slave. Heliogabalus introduced an element of absurdity&mdash;one
ticket for a golden vase, another for six flies. This custom
descended to the festivals given by the feudal and merchant
princes of Europe, especially of Italy; and it formed a prominent
feature of the splendid court hospitality of Louis XIV. In
the Italian republics of the 16th century the lottery principle was
applied to encourage the sale of merchandise. The lotto of
Florence and the seminario of Genoa are well known, and Venice
established a monopoly and drew a considerable revenue for
the state. The first letters patent for a lottery in France were
granted in 1539 by Francis I., and in 1656 the Italian, Lorenzo
Tonti (the originator of &ldquo;Tontines&rdquo;) opened another for the
building of a stone bridge between the Louvre and the Faubourg
St Germain. The institution became very popular in France,
and gradually assumed an important place in the government
finance. The parlements frequently protested against it, but it
had the support of Mazarin, and L. Phelypeaux, comte de
Pontchartrain, by this means raised the expenses of the Spanish
Succession War. Necker, in his <i>Administration des finances</i>,
estimates the public charge for lotteries at 4,000,000 livres per
annum. There were also lotteries for the benefit of religious communities
and charitable purposes. Two of the largest were the
<i>Loteries de Piété</i> and <i>Des Enfans Trouvés</i>. These and also the
great <i>Loterie de l&rsquo;École militaire</i> were practically merged in the
<i>Loterie Royale</i> by the decree of 1776, suppressing all private
lotteries in France. The financial basis of these larger lotteries
was to take <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">24</span>ths for expenses and benefit, and return <span class="spp">19</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">24</span>ths
to the public who subscribed. The calculation of chances had
become a familiar science. It is explained in detail by Caminade
de Castres in <i>Enc. méth. finances</i>, ii. <i>s.v.</i> &ldquo;Loterie.&rdquo; The
names of the winning numbers in the first drawing were (1)
<i>extrait</i>, (2) <i>ambe</i>, (3) <i>terne</i>, (4) <i>quaterne</i>, (5) <i>quine</i>. After this
there were four drawings called <i>primes gratuites</i>. The <i>extrait</i>
gave fifteen times the price of the ticket; the <i>quine</i> gave one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
million times the price. These are said to be much more favourable
terms than were given in Vienna, Frankfort and other
leading European cities at the end of the 18th century. The
<i>Loterie Royale</i> was ultimately suppressed in 1836. Under the law
of the 29th of May 1844 lotteries may be held for the assistance
of charity and the fine arts. In 1878 twelve million lottery
tickets of one franc each were sold in Paris to pay for prizes to
exhibitors in the great Exhibition and expenses of working-men
visitors. The first prize was worth £5000; the second, £4000,
and the third and fourth £2000 each. The Société du Crédit
Foncier, and many of the large towns, are permitted to contract
loans, the periodical repayments of which are determined by
lot. This practice, which is prohibited in Germany and England,
resembles the older system of giving higher and lower rates of
interest for money according to lot. Lotteries were suppressed
in Belgium in 1830, Sweden in 1841 and Switzerland in 1865,
but they still figure in the state budgets of Austria-Hungary,
Prussia and other German States, Holland, Spain, Italy and
Denmark. In addition to lottery loans, ordinary lotteries
(<i>occasion lotteries</i>) are numerous in various countries of the continent
of Europe. They are of various magnitude and are
organized for a variety of purposes, such as charity, art, agriculture,
church-building, &amp;c. It is becoming the tendency, however,
to discourage private and indiscriminate lotteries, and even state
lotteries which contribute to the revenue. In Austria-Hungary
and Germany, for instance, every year sees fewer places where
tickets can be taken for them receive licenses. In 1904 a
proposal for combining a working-class savings bank with a
national lottery was seriously considered by the Prussian
ministry. The scheme, which owes its conception to August
Scherl, editor of the Berlin <i>Lokalanzeiger</i>, is an endeavour to
utilize the love of gambling for the purpose of promoting thrift
among the working-classes. It was proposed to make weekly
collections from subscribers, in fixed amounts, ranging from
sixpence to four shillings. The interest on the money deposited
would not go to the depositors but would be set aside to form
the prizes. Three hundred thousand tickets, divisible into
halves, quarters and eighths, according to the sum deposited
weekly, would form a series of 12,500 prizes, of a total value
of £27,000. At the same time, the subscriber, while having his
ordinary lottery chances of these prizes, still has to his credit
intact the amount which he has subscribed week by week.</p>

<p>In England the earliest lotteries sanctioned by government
were for such purposes as the repair of harbours in 1569, and the
Virginia Company in 1612. In the lottery of 1569, 40,000 chances
were sold at ten shillings each, the prizes being &ldquo;plate, and certain
sorts of merchandises.&rdquo; In 1698 lotteries, with the exception
of the Royal Oak lottery for the benefit of the Royal Fishing
Company, were prohibited as common nuisances, by which
children, servants and other unwary persons had been ruined.
This prohibition was in the 18th century gradually extended
to illegal insurances on marriages and other events, and to a great
many games with dice, such as faro, basset, hazard, except
backgammon and games played in the royal palace. In spite of
these prohibitions, the government from 1709 down to 1824
annually raised considerable sums in lotteries authorized by
act of parliament. The prizes were in the form of terminable or
perpetual annuities. The £10 tickets were sold at a premium
of say 40% to contractors who resold them in retail (sometimes in
one-sixteenth parts) by &ldquo;morocco men,&rdquo; or men with red leather
books who travelled through the country. As the drawing extended
over forty days, a very pernicious system arose of insuring
the fate of tickets during the drawing for a small premium of
4d. or 6d. This was partly cured by the Little Go Act of 1802,
directed against the itinerant wheels which plied between the
state lotteries, and partly by Perceval&rsquo;s Act in 1806, which
confined the drawing of each lottery to one day. From 1793 to
1824 the government made an average yearly profit of £346,765.
Cope, one of the largest contractors, is said to have spent £36,000
in advertisements in a single year. The English lotteries were
used to raise loans for general purposes, but latterly they were
confined to particular objects, such as the improvement of
London, the disposal of a museum, the purchase of a picture
gallery, &amp;c. Through the efforts of Lord Lyttleton and others
a strong public opinion was formed against them, and in 1826
they were finally prohibited. An energetic proposal to revive
the system was made before the select committee on metropolitan
improvements in 1830, but it was not listened to. By a unique
blunder in legislation, authority was given to hold a lottery
under an act of 1831 which provided a scheme for the improvement
of the city of Glasgow. These &ldquo;Glasgow lotteries&rdquo;
were suppressed by an act of 1834. Art Unions were legalized
by the Art Unions Act 1846. The last lottery prominently
before the public in England was that of Dethier&rsquo;s twelfth-cake
lottery, which was suppressed on the 27th of December 1860.
As defined at the beginning of this article, the word lottery has a
meaning wide enough to include missing-word competitions,
distributions by tradesmen of prize coupons, sweepstakes, &amp;c.
See <i>Report of Joint Select Committee on Lotteries, &amp;c.</i> (1908).
The statute law in Scotland is the same as in England. At
common law in Scotland it is probable that all lotteries and raffles,
for whatever purpose held, may be indicted as nuisances. The
art unions are supposed to be protected by a special statute.</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;The American Congress of 1776 instituted a
national lottery. Most states at that time legalized lotteries
for public objects, and before 1820 the Virginia legislature
passed seventy acts authorizing lotteries for various public
purposes, such as schools, roads, &amp;c.&mdash;about 85% of the
subscriptions being returned in prizes. At an early period (1795)
the city of Washington was empowered to set up lotteries
as a mode of raising money for public purposes; and this
authorization from the Maryland legislature was approved by
an act of the Federal Congress in 1812. In 1833 they were
prohibited in New York and Massachusetts and gradually in the
other states, until they survived only in Louisiana. In that
state, the Louisiana State Lottery, a company chartered in
1868, had a monopoly for which it paid $40,000 to the state
treasury. Its last charter was granted in 1879 for a period of
twenty-five years, and a renewal was refused in 1890. In 1890
Congress forbade the use of the mails for promoting any lottery
enterprise by a statute so stringent that it was held to make it a
penal offence to employ them to further the sale of Austrian
government bonds, issued under a scheme for drawing some
by lot for payment at a premium (see <i>Horner</i> v. <i>United States</i>,
147 United States Reports, 449). This had the effect of compelling
the Louisiana State Lottery to move its quarters to
Honduras, in which place it still exists, selling its bonds to a
considerable extent in the Southern States.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Since lotteries have become illegal there have been a great number
of judicial decisions defining a lottery. In general, where skill or
judgment is to be exercised there is no lottery, the essential element
of which is chance or lot. There are numerous statutes against
lotteries, the reason being given that they &ldquo;tend to promote a
gambling spirit,&rdquo; and that it is the duty of the state to &ldquo;protect
the morals and advance the welfare of the people.&rdquo; In New York
the Constitution of 1846 forbade lotteries, and by § 324 of the
Penal Code a lottery is declared &ldquo;unlawful and a public nuisance.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Contriving&rdquo; and advertising lotteries is also penal. The following
have been held illegal lotteries: In New York, a concert, the tickets
for which entitled the holder to a prize to be drawn by lot; in Indiana,
offering a gold watch to the purchaser of goods who guesses the
number of beans in a bottle; in Texas, selling &ldquo;prize candy&rdquo; boxes;
and operating a nickel-in-the-slot machine&mdash;so also in Louisiana;
in Massachusetts, the &ldquo;policy&rdquo; or &ldquo;envelope game,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;raffle&rdquo;;
in Kentucky (1905), prize coupon packages, the coupons having to
spell a certain word (<i>U.S.</i> v. <i>Jefferson</i>, 134 Fed. R. 299); in Kansas
(1907) it was held by the Supreme Court that the gift of a hat-pin
to each purchaser was not illegal as a &ldquo;gift enterprise,&rdquo; there being
no chance or lot. In Oklahoma (1907) it was held that the making
of contracts for the payment of money, the certainty in value of
return being dependent on chance, was a lottery (<i>Fidelity Fund Co.</i>
v. <i>Vaughan</i>, 90 Pac. Rep. 34). The chief features of a lottery are
&ldquo;procuring through lot or chance, by the investment of a sum of
money or something of value, some greater amount of money or thing
of greater value. When such are the chief features of any scheme
whatever it may be christened, or however it may be guarded or
concealed by cunningly devised conditions or screens, it is under
the law a lottery&rdquo; (<i>U.S.</i> v. <i>Wallace</i>, 58, Fed. Rep. 942). In 1894
and 1897 Congress forbade the importation of lottery tickets or
advertisements into the United States. In 1899, setting up or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
promoting lotteries in Alaska was prohibited by Congress, and in
1900 it forbade any lottery or sale of lottery tickets in Hawaii. In
Porto Rico lotteries, raffles and gift-enterprises are forbidden (Penal
Code, 1902, § 291).</p>

<p><a name="ft1h" id="ft1h" href="#fa1h"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The word &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; is directly derived from Ital. <i>lotteria</i>, cf.
Fr. <i>loterie</i>, formed from <i>lotto</i>, lot, game of chance. &ldquo;Lot&rdquo; is in
origin a Teutonic word, adopted into Romanic languages. In O. Eng.
it appears as <i>hlot</i>, cf. Dutch <i>lot</i>, Ger. <i>Loos</i>, Dan. <i>lod</i>, &amp;c. The meaning
of the Teutonic root <i>hleut</i> from which these words have derived is
unknown. Primarily &ldquo;lot&rdquo; meant the object, such as a disk or
counter of wood, a pebble, bean or the like, which was drawn or
cast to decide by chance, under divine guidance, various matters,
such as disputes, divisions of property, selection of officers and
frequently as a method of divination in ancient times. From this
original sense the meaning develops into that which falls to a person
by lot, chance or fate, then to any portion of land, &amp;c., allotted to
a person, and hence, quite generally, of a quantity of anything.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTTI, ANTONIO<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (1667?-1740), Italian musical composer,
was the son of Matteo Lotti, Kapellmeister to the court of
Hanover. He was born, however, at Venice and as a pupil of
Legrenzi. He entered the Doge&rsquo;s chapel as a boy, and in 1689
was engaged as an alto singer, succeeding later to the posts of
deputy organist (1690), second organist (1692), first organist
(1704), and, finally, in 1736 Maestro di Cappella at St Mark&rsquo;s
church. He was also a composer of operas, and having attracted
the interest of the crown prince of Saxony during his visit to
Venice in 1712, he was invited to Dresden, where he went in
1717. After producing three operas there he was obliged to
return to his duties at Venice in 1719. He died on the 5th of
January 1740. Like many other Venetian composers he wrote
operas for Vienna, and enjoyed a considerable reputation outside
Italy. A volume of madrigals published in 1705 contains the
famous <i>In una siepe ombrosa</i>, passed off by Bononcini as his own
in London. Another is quoted by Martini in his <i>Saggio di
Contrappunto</i>. Among his pupils were Alberti, Bassani, Galuppi,
Gasparini and Marcello. Burney justly praises his church music,
which is severe in style, but none the less modern in its grace and
pathos. A fine setting of the <i>Dies Irae</i> is in the Imperial Library
at Vienna, and some of his masses have been printed in the
collections of Proske and Lück.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LOTTO, LORENZO<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1480-1556), Italian painter, is variously
stated to have been born at Bergamo, Venice and Treviso,
between 1475 and 1480, but a document published by Dr Bampo
proves that he was born in Venice, and it is to be gathered from
his will that 1480 was probably the year of his birth. Overshadowed
by the genius of his three great contemporaries, Titian,
Giorgione and Palma, he had been comparatively neglected by
art historians until Mr Bernhard Berenson devoted to him an
&ldquo;essay in constructive art criticism,&rdquo; which not only restores
to him his rightful position among the great masters of the
Renaissance, but also throws clear light upon the vexed question
of his artistic descent. Earlier authorities have made Lotto a
pupil of Giovanni Bellini (Morelli), of Previtali (Crowe and
Cavalcaselle), of Leonardo da Vinci (Lomazzo), whilst others
discovered in his work the influences of Cima, Carpaccio, Dürer,
Palma and Francia. Mr Berenson has, however, proved that he
was the pupil of Alvise Vivarini, whose religious severity and
asceticism remained paramount in his work, even late in his life,
when he was attracted by the rich glow of Giorgione&rsquo;s and
Titian&rsquo;s colour. What distinguishes Lotto from his more famous
contemporaries is his psychological insight into character and
his personal vision&mdash;his unconventionality, which is sufficient
to account for the comparative neglect suffered by him when his
art is placed beside the more typical art of Titian and Giorgione,
the supreme expression of the character of the period.</p>

<p>That Lotto, who was one of the most productive painters of his
time, could work for thirty years without succumbing to the
mighty influence of Titian&rsquo;s sumptuous colour, is explained
by the fact that during these years he was away from Venice,
as is abundantly proved by documents and by the evidence of
signed and dated works. The first of these documents, dated
1503, proves him to have lived at Treviso at this period. His
earliest authentic pictures, Sir Martin Conway&rsquo;s &ldquo;Danaë&rdquo;
(about 1498) and the &ldquo;St Jerome&rdquo; of the Louvre (a similar
subject is at the Madrid Gallery ascribed to Titian), as indeed
all the works executed before 1509, have unmistakable Vivarinesque
traits in the treatment of the drapery and landscape, and
cool grey tonality. To this group belong the Madonnas at
Bridgewater House, Villa Borghese, Naples, and Sta Cristina
near Treviso, the Recanati altarpiece, the &ldquo;Assumption of the
Virgin&rdquo; at Asolo, and the portrait of a young man at Hampton
Court. We find him at Rome between 1508 and 1512, at the time
Raphael was painting in the Stanza della Signatura. A document
in the Corsini library mentions that Lotto received 100 ducats as
an advance payment for fresco-work in the upper floor of the
Vatican, but there is no evidence that this work was ever executed.
In the next dated works, the &ldquo;Entombment&rdquo; at Jesi (1512),
and the &ldquo;Transfiguration,&rdquo; &ldquo;St James,&rdquo; and &ldquo;St Vincent&rdquo; at
Recanati, Lotto has abandoned the dryness and cool colour of
his earlier style, and adopted a fluid method and a blonde, joyful
colouring. In 1513 we find him at Bergamo, where he had
entered into a contract to paint for 500 gold ducats an altarpiece
for S. Stefano. The picture was only completed in 1516, and is
now at S. Bartolommeo. From the next years, spent mostly at
Bergamo, with intervals in Venice and Jesi in the Marches, date
the Dresden &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ taking leave of his Mother&rdquo;
at the Berlin Gallery, the &ldquo;Bride and Bridegroom&rdquo; at Madrid,
the National Gallery &ldquo;Family Group&rdquo; and portrait of the
Protonothary Giuliano, several portraits in Berlin, Milan and
Vienna, numerous altarpieces in and near Bergamo, the strangely
misnamed &ldquo;Triumph of Chastity&rdquo; at the Rospigliosi Palace in
Rome, and the portrait of Andrea Odoni at Hampton Court.
In 1526 or 1527 Lotto returned to Venice, where Titian ruled
supreme in the world of art; and it was only natural that the
example of the great master should have fired him to emulation,
though his experiments in this direction were confined to an
attempt at rivalling the master&rsquo;s rich and ruddy colour-schemes.
Even in the Carmine altarpiece, the &ldquo;St Nicholas of Bari,&rdquo;
which is his nearest approach to Titian, he retained his individualized,
as opposed to Titian&rsquo;s generalized, expression of emotion.
But it was only a passing phase, and he soon returned to the
cooler schemes of his earlier work. Among his chief pictures
executed in Venice between 1529 and 1540 are the &ldquo;Christ and
the Adulteress,&rdquo; now at the Louvre, the &ldquo;Visitation&rdquo; at the
Jesi Library, the &ldquo;Crucifixion&rdquo; at Monte S. Giusto, the Madonna
at the Uffizi, the &ldquo;Madonna and Saints&rdquo; at Cingoli, and some
portraits at the Berlin and Vienna museums, the Villa Borghese
and Doria Palace in Rome, and at Dorchester House. He is
again to be found at Treviso from 1542-1545, at Ancona in 1550, the
year in which he entirely lost his voice; and in 1552 he &ldquo;devoted
his person and all his property to the Holy Virgin of Loreto&rdquo; and
took up his abode with the monks of that shrine. He died
in 1556. A codex in his own handwriting, discovered in the
archives of Loreto, not only includes a complete statement of
his accounts from about 1539 to his death, but has a most
interesting entry from which we gather that in 1540 Lotto
completed the portraits of Martin Luther and his wife. These
portraits could not have been painted from life; they were
presumably executed from some contemporary engraving.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTTO<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (Ital. for &ldquo;lot&rdquo;), a gambling game usually called <i>Keno</i>
in America, played by any number of persons upon large boards
or cards, each of which is divided into three horizontal rows of
nine spaces, four spaces in each row being left blank and the other
five marked with numbers up to 90. Each card is designated by
a general number. The cards usually lie on the gambling-table,
and a player may buy from the bank as many as he cares to use,
each card being registered or <i>pegged</i> on an exposed table as soon
as bought. Ninety small ivory markers, generally balls flattened
on one side, numbered from 1 to 90, are placed in a bag and shaken
out one by one, or, more usually, in a so-called <i>keno-goose</i>, a kind
of urn with a spout through which the balls are allowed to roll by
means of a spring. When a number falls out, the banker, or
<i>keno-roller</i>, calls it out distinctly, and each player upon whose
card that number occurs places a mark over it. This is repeated
until one player has all the numbers in one row of his card
covered, upon which he calls out &ldquo;Keno!&rdquo; and wins all the
money staked excepting a percentage to the bank.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTUS,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> a popular name applied to several plants. The lotus
fruits of the Greeks belonged to <i>Zizyphus Lotus</i>, a bush native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
in south Europe with fruits as large as sloes, containing a mealy
substance which can be used for making bread and also a fermented
drink. In ancient times the fruits were an important
article of food among the poor; whence &ldquo;lotophagi&rdquo; or lotus-eaters.
<i>Zizyphus</i> is a member of the natural order Rhamnaceae
to which belongs the British buckthorn. The Egyptian lotus
was a water-lily, <i>Nymphaea Lotus</i>; as also is the sacred lotus of
the Hindus, <i>Nelumbium speciosum</i>. The lotus tree, known to
the Romans as the Libyan lotus, and planted by them for shade,
was probably <i>Celtis australis</i>, the nettle-tree (<i>q.v.</i>), a southern
European tree, a native of the elm family, with fruits like small
cherries, which are first red and then black. <i>Lotus</i> of botanists
is a genus of the pea-family (<i>Leguminosae</i>), containing a large
number of species of herbs and undershrubs widely distributed
in the temperate regions of the old world. It is represented in
Britain by <i>L. corniculatus</i>, bird&rsquo;s foot trefoil, a low-growing herb,
common in pastures and waste places, with clusters of small
bright yellow pea-like flowers, which are often streaked with
crimson; the popular name is derived from the pods which when
ripe spread like the toes of a bird&rsquo;s foot.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTUS-EATERS<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Lôtophagoi">&#923;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span>), a Libyan tribe known
to the Greeks as early as the time of Homer. Herodotus (iv.
177) describes their country as in the Libyan district bordering
on the Syrtes, and says that a caravan route led from it to Egypt.
Victor Bérard identifies it with the modern Jerba. When
Odysseus reached the country of the Lotophagi, many of his
sailors after eating the lotus lost all wish to return home. Both
Greeks and Romans used the expression &ldquo;to eat the lotus&rdquo;
to denote forgetfulness (cf. Tennyson&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;The Lotus-Eaters&rdquo;).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There has been considerable discussion as to the identification of
the Homeric lotus. Some have held that it is a prickly shrub,
Zizyphus Lotus, which bears a sweet-tasting fruit, and still grows
in the old home of the Lotophagi. It is eaten by the natives, who
also make a kind of wine from the juice. P. Champault (<i>Phéniciens
et Grecs en Italie d&rsquo;après l&rsquo;Odyssée</i>, p. 400, note 2), however, maintains
that the lotus was a date; Victor Bérard (<i>Les Phéniciens et l&rsquo;Odyssée</i>,
1902-1903, ii. 102) is doubtful, but contends that it was certainly a
tree-fruit. If either of these be correct, then the lotus of <i>Od.</i> iv.
603-604 is quite a different plant, a kind of clover. Now Strabo
(xvii. 829<i>a</i>) calls the lotus <span class="grk" title="poan tina kai rhizan">&#960;&#972;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8165;&#943;&#950;&#945;&#957;</span>. Putting these two
references together with Sulpicius Severus, <i>Dialogi</i> i. 4. 4, R. M.
Henry suggests that the Homeric lotus was really the <span class="grk" title="poa">&#960;&#972;&#945;</span> of Strabo,
<i>i.e.</i> a kind of clover (<i>Classical Review</i>, December 1906, p. 435).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOTZE, RUDOLF HERMANN<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1817-1881), German philosopher,
was born in Bautzen on the 21st of May 1817, the son of a
physician. He received his education in the gymnasium of
Zittau under teachers who inspired him with an enduring love
of the classical authors, as we see from his translation of the
<i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles into Latin verse, published when he had
reached middle life. He went to the university of Leipzig
as a student of philosophy and natural sciences, but entered
officially as a student of medicine. He was then only seventeen.
It appears that thus early Lotze&rsquo;s studies were governed by two
distinct interests. The first was scientific, based upon mathematical
and physical studies under the guidance of E. H. Weber,
W. Volckmann and G. T. Fechner. The other was his aesthetical
and artistic interest, which was developed under the care of C. H.
Weisse. To the former he owes his appreciation of exact
investigation and a complete knowledge of the aims of science,
to the latter an equal admiration for the great circle of ideas
which had been diffused by the teaching of Fichte, Schelling
and Hegel. Each of these influences, which early in life must
have been familiar to him, tempered and modified the other.
The true method of science which he possessed forced him to
condemn as useless the entire form which Schelling&rsquo;s and Hegel&rsquo;s
expositions had adopted, especially the dialectic method of the
latter, whilst his love of art and beauty, and his appreciation of
moral purposes, revealed to him the existence of a trans-phenomenal
world of values into which no exact science could
penetrate. It is evident how this initial position at once defined
to him the tasks which philosophy had to perform. First there
were the natural sciences, themselves only just emerging from
a confused conception of their true method; especially those
which studied the borderland of physical and mental phenomena,
the medical sciences; and pre-eminently that science which
has since become so popular, the science of biology.</p>

<p>Lotze&rsquo;s first essay was his dissertation <i>De futurae biologiae
principibus philosophicis</i>, with which he gained (1838) the degree
of doctor of medicine, after having only four months previously
got the degree of doctor of philosophy. Then, secondly, there
arose the question whether the methods of exact science sufficed
to explain the connexion of phenomena, or whether for the explanation
of this the thinking mind was forced to resort to some
hypothesis not immediately verifiable by observation, but
dictated by higher aspirations and interests. And, if to satisfy
these we were forced to maintain the existence of a world of
moral standards, it was, thirdly, necessary to form some opinion
as to the relation of these moral standards of value to the forms
and facts of phenomenal existence. These different tasks,
which philosophy had to fulfil, mark pretty accurately the
aims of Lotze&rsquo;s writings, and the order in which they were
published. He laid the foundation of his philosophical system
very early in his <i>Metaphysik</i> (Leipzig, 1841) and his <i>Logik</i>
(1843), short books published while he was still a junior lecturer
at Leipzig, from which university he migrated to Göttingen,
succeeding Herbart in the chair of philosophy. But it was
only during the last decade of his life that he ventured, with
much hesitation, to present his ideas in a systematic and final
form. The two books mentioned remained unnoticed by the
reading public, and Lotze first became known to a larger circle
through a series of works which aimed at establishing in the
study of the physical and mental phenomena of the human
organism in its normal and diseased states the same general
principles which had been adopted in the investigation of inorganic
phenomena. These works were his <i>Allgemeine Pathologie
und Therapie als mechanische Naturwissenschaften</i> (Leipzig,
1842, 2nd ed., 1848), the articles &ldquo;Lebenskraft&rdquo; (1843) and
&ldquo;Seele und Seelenleben&rdquo; (1846) in Rud. Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Handwörterbuch
der Physiologie</i>, his <i>Allgemeine Physiologie des Körperlichen
Lebens</i> (Leipzig, 1851), and his <i>Medizinische Psychologie
oder Physiologie der Seele</i> (Leipzig, 1852).</p>

<p>When Lotze published these works, medical science was still
much under the influence of Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy of nature.
The mechanical laws, to which external things were subject,
were conceived as being valid only in the inorganic world;
in the organic and mental worlds these mechanical laws were
conceived as being disturbed or overridden by other powers,
such as the influence of final causes, the existence of types,
the work of vital and mental forces. This confusion Lotze,
who had been trained in the school of mathematical reasoning,
tried to dispel. The laws which govern particles of matter in
the inorganic world govern them likewise if they are joined into
an organism. A phenomenon <i>a</i>, if followed by <i>b</i> in the one case,
is followed by the same <i>b</i> also in the other case. Final causes,
vital and mental forces, the soul itself can, if they act at all,
only act through the inexorable mechanism of natural laws.
As we therefore have only to do with the study of existing
complexes of material and spiritual phenomena, the changes
in these must be explained in science by the rule of mechanical
laws, such as obtain everywhere in the world, and only by such.
One of the results of these investigations was to extend the
meaning of the word mechanism, and comprise under it all laws
which obtain in the phenomenal world, not excepting the
phenomena of life and mind. Mechanism was the unalterable
connexion of every phenomenon a with other phenomena <i>b</i>,
<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, either as following or preceding it; mechanism was the
inexorable form into which the events of this world are cast,
and by which they are connected. The object of those writings
was to establish the all-pervading rule of mechanism. But
the mechanical view of nature is not identical with the materialistic.
In the last of the above-mentioned works the question
is discussed at great length how we have to consider mind, and
the relation between mind and body; the answer is&mdash;we have
to consider mind as an immaterial principle, its action, however,
on the body and vice versa as purely mechanical, indicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
by the fixed laws of a psycho-physical mechanism. These
doctrines of Lotze&mdash;though pronounced with the distinct and
reiterated reserve that they did not contain a solution of the
philosophical question regarding the nature, origin, or deeper
meaning of this all-pervading mechanism, neither an explanation
how the action of external things on each other takes place
nor yet of the relation of mind and body, that they were merely
a preliminary formula of practical scientific value, itself requiring
a deeper interpretation&mdash;these doctrines were nevertheless
by many considered to be the last word of the philosopher who,
denouncing the reveries of Schelling or the idealistic theories
of Hegel, established the science of life and mind on the same
basis as that of material things. Published as they were during
the years when the modern school of German materialism was
at its height,<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> these works of Lotze were counted among the
opposition literature which destroyed the phantom of Hegelian
wisdom and vindicated the independent and self-sufficing
position of empirical philosophy. Even philosophers of the
eminence of I. H. Fichte (the younger) did not escape this misinterpretation
of Lotze&rsquo;s true meaning, though they had his
<i>Metaphysik</i> and <i>Logik</i> to refer to, though he promised in his
<i>Allgemeine Physiologie</i> (1851) to enter in a subsequent work
upon the &ldquo;bounding province between aesthetics and physiology,&rdquo;
and though in his <i>Medizinische Psychologie</i> he had
distinctly stated that his position was neither the idealism of
Hegel nor the realism of Herbart, nor materialism, but that
it was the conviction that the essence of everything is the part
it plays in the realization of some idea which is in itself valuable,
that the sense of an all-pervading mechanism is to be sought
in this, that it denotes the ways and means by which the highest
idea, which we may call the idea of the good, has voluntarily
chosen to realize itself.</p>

<p>The misinterpretations which he had suffered induced Lotze
to publish a small pamphlet of a polemical character (<i>Streitschriften</i>,
Leipzig, 1857), in which he corrected two mistakes.
The opposition which he had made to Hegel&rsquo;s formalism had
induced some to associate him with the materialistic school,
others to count him among the followers of Herbart. Lotze
publicly and formally denied that he belonged to the school of
Herbart, though he admitted that historically the same doctrine
which might be considered the forerunner of Herbart&rsquo;s teachings
might lead to his own views, viz. the monadology of Leibnitz.</p>

<p>When Lotze wrote these explanations, he had already given
to the world the first volume of his great work, <i>Mikrokosmus</i>
(vol. i. 1856, vol. ii. 1858, vol. iii. 1864; 3rd ed., 1876-1880).
In many passages of his works on pathology, physiology, and
psychology Lotze had distinctly stated that the method of
research which he advocated there did not give an explanation
of the phenomena of life and mind, but only the means of
observing and connecting them together; that the meaning
of all phenomena, and the reason of their peculiar connexions,
was a philosophical problem which required to be attacked from
a different point of view; and that the significance especially
which lay in the phenomena of life and mind would only unfold
itself if by an exhaustive survey of the entire life of man, individually,
socially, and historically, we gain the necessary
data for deciding what meaning attaches to the existence of
this microcosm, or small world of human life, in the macrocosm
of the universe. This review, which extends, in three volumes,
over the wide field of anthropology, beginning with the human
frame, the soul, and their union in life, advancing to man,
his mind, and the course of the world, and concluding with
history, progress, and the connexion of things, ends with the
same idea which was expressed in Lotze&rsquo;s earliest work, his
<i>Metaphysik</i>. The view peculiar to him is reached in the end as
the crowning conception towards which all separate channels
of thought have tended, and in the light of which the life of man
in nature and mind, in the individual and in society, had been
surveyed. This view can be briefly stated as follows: Everywhere
in the wide realm of observation we find three distinct
regions,&mdash;the region of facts, the region of laws and the region
of standards of value. These three regions are separate only in
our thoughts, not in reality. To comprehend the real position
we are forced to the conviction that the world of facts is the
field in which, and that laws are the means by which, those higher
standards of moral and aesthetical value are being realized;
and such a union can again only become intelligible through
the idea of a personal Deity, who in the creation and preservation
of a world has voluntarily chosen certain forms and laws, through
the natural operation of which the ends of His work are gained.</p>

<p>Whilst Lotze had thus in his published works closed the circle
of his thought, beginning with a conception metaphysically
gained, proceeding to an exhaustive contemplation of things
in the light it afforded, and ending with the stronger conviction
of its truth which observation, experience, and life could afford,
he had all the time been lecturing on the various branches of
philosophy according to the scheme of academical instruction
transmitted from his predecessors. Nor can it be considered
anything but a gain that he was thus induced to expound his
views with regard to those topics, and in connexion with those
problems, which were the traditional forms of philosophical
utterance. His lectures ranged over a wide field: he delivered
annually lectures on psychology and on logic (the latter including
a survey of the entirety of philosophical research under the
title <i>Encyclopädie der Philosophie</i>), then at longer intervals
lectures on metaphysics, philosophy of nature, philosophy of
art, philosophy of religion, rarely on history of philosophy and
ethics. In these lectures he expounded his peculiar views in
a stricter form, and during the last decade of his life he embodied
the substance of those courses in his <i>System der Philosophie</i>,
of which only two volumes have appeared (vol. i. <i>Logik</i>, 1st ed.,
Leipzig, 1874, 2nd ed., 1880; vol. ii. <i>Metaphysik</i>, 1879). The
third and concluding volume, which was to treat in a more
condensed form the principal problems of practical philosophy,
of philosophy of art and religion, never appeared. A small
pamphlet on psychology, containing the last form in which he
had begun to treat the subject in his lectures (abruptly terminated
through his death on the 1st of July 1881) during the summer
session of 1881, has been published by his son. Appended to
this volume is a complete list of Lotze&rsquo;s writings, compiled by
Professor Rehnisch of Göttingen.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>To understand this series of Lotze&rsquo;s writings, it is necessary to
begin with his definition of philosophy. This is given after his
exposition of logic has established two points, viz. the existence in
our mind of certain laws and forms according to which we connect
the material supplied to us by our senses, and, secondly, the fact that
logical thought cannot be usefully employed without the assumption
of a further set of connexions, not logically necessary, but
assumed to exist between the data of experience and observation.
These connexions of a real not formal character are handed to us
by the separate sciences and by the usage and culture of everyday
life. Language has crystallized them into certain definite notions
and expressions, without which we cannot proceed a single step,
but which we have accepted without knowing their exact meaning,
much less their origin. In consequence the special sciences and the
wisdom of common life entangle themselves easily and frequently
in contradictions. A problem of a purely formal character thus
presents itself, viz. this&mdash;to try to bring unity and harmony into
the scattered thoughts of our general culture, to trace them to their
primary assumptions and follow them into their ultimate consequences,
to connect them all together, to remodel, curtail or amplify
them, so as to remove their apparent contradictions, and to combine
them in the unity of an harmonious view of things, and especially
to investigate those conceptions which form the initial assumptions
of the several sciences, and to fix the limits of their applicability.
This is the formal definition of philosophy. Whether an harmonious
conception thus gained will represent more than an agreement
among our thoughts, whether it will represent the real connexion of
things and thus possess objective not merely subjective value, cannot
be decided at the outset. It is also unwarranted to start with the
expectation that everything in the world should be explained by one
principle, and it is a needless restriction of our means to expect unity
of method. Nor are we able to start our philosophical investigations
by an inquiry into the nature of human thought and its capacity to
attain an objective knowledge, as in this case we would be actually
using that instrument the usefulness of which we were trying to
determine. The main proof of the objective value of the view we
may gain will rather lie in the degree in which it succeeds in assigning
to every element of culture its due position, or in which it is able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
appreciate and combine different and apparently opposite tendencies
and interests, in the sort of justice with which it weighs our manifold
desires and aspirations, balancing them in due proportions, refusing
to sacrifice to a one-sided principle any truth or conviction which experience
has proven to be useful and necessary. The investigations
will then naturally divide themselves into three parts, the first of
which deals with those to our mind inevitable forms in which we
are obliged to think about things, if we think at all (metaphysics),
the second being devoted to the great region of facts, trying to
apply the results of metaphysics to these, specially the two great
regions of external and mental phenomena (cosmology and psychology),
the third dealing with those standards of value from
which we pronounce our aesthetical or ethical approval or disapproval.
In each department we shall have to aim first of all at
views clear and consistent within themselves, but, secondly, we shall
in the end wish to form some general idea or to risk an opinion how
laws, facts and standards of value may be combined in one comprehensive
view. Considerations of this latter kind will naturally
present themselves in the two great departments of cosmology and
psychology, or they may be delegated to an independent research
under the name of religious philosophy. We have already mentioned
the final conception in which Lotze&rsquo;s speculation culminates, that of
a personal Deity, Himself the essence of all that merits existence for
its own sake, who in the creation and government of a world has
voluntarily chosen certain laws and forms through which His ends
are to be realized. We may add that according to this view nothing
is real but the living spirit of God and the world of living spirits
which He has created; the things of this world have only reality in
so far as they are the appearance of spiritual substance, which
underlies everything. It is natural that Lotze, having this great
and final conception always before him, works under its influence
from the very beginning of his speculations, permitting us, as
we progress, to gain every now and then a glimpse of that interpretation
of things which to him contains the solution of our
difficulties.</p>

<p>The key to Lotze&rsquo;s theoretical philosophy lies in his metaphysics,
to the exposition of which important subject the first and last of
his larger publications have been devoted. To understand Lotze&rsquo;s
philosophy, a careful and repeated perusal of these works is absolutely
necessary. The object of his metaphysics is so to remodel
the current notions regarding the existence of things and their
connexions with which the usage of language supplies us as to
make them consistent and thinkable. The further assumption,
that the modified notions thus gained have an objective meaning,
and that they somehow correspond to the real order of the existing
world which of course they can never actually describe, depends
upon a general confidence which we must have in our reasoning
powers, and in the significance of a world in which we ourselves
with all the necessary courses of our thoughts have a due place
assigned. The principle therefore of these investigations is opposed
to two attempts frequently repeated in the history of philosophy,
viz.: (1) the attempt to establish general laws or forms, which the
development of things must have obeyed, or which a Creator must
have followed in the creation of a world (Hegel); and (2) the attempt
to trace the genesis of our notions and decide as to their meaning and
value (modern theories of knowledge). Neither of these attempts is
practicable. The world of many things surrounds us; our notions,
by which we manage correctly or incorrectly to describe it, are also
ready made. What remains to be done is, not to explain how such a
world manages to be what it is, nor how we came to form these
notions, but merely this&mdash;to expel from the circle and totality of our
conceptions those abstract notions which are inconsistent and jarring,
or to remodel and define them so that they may constitute a consistent
and harmonious view. In this endeavour Lotze discards as useless
and untenable many favourite conceptions of the school, many crude
notions of everyday life. The course of things and their connexion
is only thinkable by the assumption of a plurality of existences, the
reality of which (as distinguished from our knowledge of them) can
be conceived only as a multitude of relations. This quality of
standing in relation to other things is that which gives to a thing its
reality. And the nature of this reality again can neither be consistently
represented as a fixed and hard substance nor as an unalterable
something, but only as a fixed order of recurrence of
continually changing events or impressions. But, further, every
attempt to think clearly what those relations are, what we really
mean, if we talk of a fixed order of events, forces upon us the necessity
of thinking also that the different things which stand in relations or
the different phases which follow each other cannot be merely
externally strung together or moved about by some indefinable
external power, in the form of some predestination or inexorable fate.
The things themselves which exist and their changing phases must
stand in some internal connexion; they themselves must be active
or passive, capable of doing or suffering. This would lead to the view
of Leibnitz, that the world consists of monads, self-sufficient beings,
leading an inner life. But this idea involves the further conception
of Leibnitz, that of a pre-established harmony, by which the Creator
has taken care to arrange the life of each monad, so that it agrees
with that of all others. This conception, according to Lotze, is
neither necessary nor thoroughly intelligible. Why not interpret at
once and render intelligible the common conception originating
in natural science, viz. that of a system of laws which governs the
many things? But, in attempting to make this conception quite
clear and thinkable, we are forced to represent the connexion of
things as a universal substance, the essence of which we conceive as
a system of laws which underlies everything and in its own self
connects everything, but imperceptible, and known to us merely
through the impressions it produces on us, which we call things.
A final reflection then teaches us that the nature of this universal
and all-pervading substance can only be imagined by us as something
analogous to our own mental life, where alone we experience
the unity of a substance (which we call self) preserved in the multitude
of its (mental) states. It also becomes clear that only where
such mental life really appears need we assign an independent
existence, but that the purposes of everyday life as well as those of
science are equally served if we deprive the material things outside
of us of an independence, and assign to them merely a connected
existence through the universal substance by the action of which
alone they can appear to us.</p>

<p>The universal substance, which we may call the absolute, is at
this stage of our investigations not endowed with the attributes
of a personal Deity, and it will remain to be seen by further analysis
in how far we are able&mdash;without contradiction&mdash;to identify it
with the object of religious veneration, in how far that which to
metaphysics is merely a postulate can be gradually brought nearer
to us and become a living power. Much in this direction is said
by Lotze in various passages of his writings; anything complete,
however, on the subject is wanting. Nor would it seem as if it
could be the intention of the author to do much more than point
out the lines on which the further treatment of the subject should
advance. The actual result of his personal inquiries, the great idea
which lies at the foundation of his philosophy, we know. It may
be safely stated that Lotze would allow much latitude to individual
convictions, as indeed it is evident that the empty notion of an
absolute can only become living and significant to us in the same
degree as experience and thought have taught us to realize the
seriousness of life, the significance of creation, the value of the
beautiful and the good, and the supreme worth of personal holiness.
To endow the universal substance with moral attributes, to maintain
that it is more than the metaphysical ground of everything, to say
it is the perfect realization of the holy, the beautiful and the good,
can only have a meaning for him who feels within himself what
real not imaginary values are clothed in those expressions.</p>

<p>We have still to mention that aesthetics formed a principal and
favourite study of Lotze&rsquo;s, and that he has treated this subject also
in the light of the leading ideas of his philosophy. See his essays
<i>Ueber den Begriff der Schönheit</i> (Göttingen, 1845) and <i>Ueber Bedingungen
der Kunstschönheit</i>, ibid. (1847); and especially his <i>Geschichte
der Aesthetik in Deutschland</i> (Munich, 1868).</p>

<p>Lotze&rsquo;s historical position is of much interest. Though he disclaims
being a follower of Herbart, his formal definition of philosophy
and his conception of the object of metaphysics are similar to those
of Herbart, who defines philosophy as an attempt to remodel the
notions given by experience. In this endeavour he forms with Herbart
an opposition to the philosophies of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel,
which aimed at objective and absolute knowledge, and also to the
criticism of Kant, which aimed at determining the validity of all
human knowledge. But this formal agreement includes material
differences, and the spirit which breathes in Lotze&rsquo;s writings is more
akin to the objects and aspirations of the idealistic school than to the
cold formalism of Herbart. What, however, with the idealists was
an object of thought alone, the absolute, is to Lotze only inadequately
definable in rigorous philosophical language; the aspirations of the
human heart, the contents of our feelings and desires, the aims of art
and the tenets of religious faith must be grasped in order to fill the
empty idea of the absolute with meaning. These manifestations of
the divine spirit again cannot be traced and understood by reducing
(as Hegel did) the growth of the human mind in the individual, in
society and in history to the monotonous rhythm of a speculative
schematism; the essence and worth which is in them reveals itself
only to the student of detail, for reality is larger and wider than
philosophy; the problem, &ldquo;how the one can be many,&rdquo; is only solved
for us in the numberless examples in life and experience which
surround us, for which we must retain a lifelong interest and which
constitute the true field of all useful human work. This conviction
of the emptiness of terms and abstract notions, and of the fulness
of individual life, has enabled Lotze to combine in his writings the
two courses into which German philosophical thought had been
moving since the death of its great founder, Leibnitz. We may
define these courses by the terms esoteric and exoteric&mdash;the former
the philosophy of the school, cultivated principally at the universities,
trying to systematize everything and reduce all our knowledge to an
intelligible principle, losing in this attempt the deeper meaning of
Leibnitz&rsquo;s philosophy; the latter the unsystematized philosophy of
general culture which we find in the work of the great writers of the
classical period, Lessing, Winkelmann, Goethe, Schiller and Herder,
all of whom expressed in some degree their indebtedness to Leibnitz.
Lotze can be said to have brought philosophy out of the lecture-room
into the market-place of life. By understanding and combining
what was great and valuable in those divided and scattered endeavours,
he became the true successor of Leibnitz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span></p>

<p>The age in which Lotze lived and wrote in Germany was not one
peculiarly fitted to appreciate the position he took up. Frequently
misunderstood, yet rarely criticized, he was nevertheless greatly
admired, listened to by devoted hearers and read by an increasing
circle. But this circle never attained to the unity of a philosophical
school. The real meaning of Lotze&rsquo;s teaching is reached only by
patient study, and those who in a larger or narrower sense call themselves
his followers will probably feel themselves indebted to him
more for the general direction he has given to their thoughts, for the
tone he has imparted to their inner life, for the seriousness with which
he has taught them to consider even small affairs and practical duties,
and for the indestructible confidence with which his philosophy
permits them to disregard the materialism of science, the scepticism
of shallow culture, the disquieting results of philosophical and
historical criticism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUBET, ÉMILE FRANÇOIS<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (1838-&emsp;&emsp;), 7th president of
the French republic, was born on the 30th of December 1838,
the son of a peasant proprietor at Marsanne (Drôme), who was
more than once mayor of Marsanne. He was admitted to the
Parisian bar in 1862, and took his doctorate-in-law next year.
He was still a student when he witnessed the sweeping triumph
of the Republican party in Paris at the general election in 1863.
He settled down to the exercise of his profession in Montélimar,
where he married in 1869 Marie Louis Picard. He also inherited
a small estate at Grignan. At the crisis of 1870 he became
mayor of Montélimar, and thenceforward was a steady supporter
of Gambetta&rsquo;s policy. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in
1876 by Montélimar he was one of the famous 363 who in June
1877 passed the vote of want of confidence in the ministry of
the duc de Broglie. In the general election of October he was
re-elected, local enthusiasm for him being increased by the fact
that the government had driven him from the mayoralty.
In the Chamber he occupied himself especially with education,
fighting the clerical system established by the Loi Falloux, and
working for the establishment of free, obligatory and secular
primary instruction. In 1880 he became president of the departmental
council in Drôme. His support of the second Jules
Ferry ministry and his zeal for the colonial expansion of France
gave him considerable weight in the moderate Republican party.
He had entered the Senate in 1885, and he became minister of
public works in the Tirard ministry (December 1887 to March
1888). In 1892 President Sadi Carnot, who was his personal
friend, asked him to form a cabinet. Loubet held the portfolio
of the interior with the premiership, and had to deal with the
anarchist crimes of that year and with the great strike of
Carmaux, in which he acted as arbitrator, giving a decision
regarded in many quarters as too favourable to the strikers.
He was defeated in November on the question of the Panama
scandals, but he retained the ministry of the interior in the next
cabinet under Alexandre Ribot, though he resigned on its reconstruction
in January. His reputation as an orator of great
force and lucidity of exposition and as a safe and honest statesman
procured for him in 1896 the presidency of the Senate, and
in February 1899 he was chosen president of the republic in
succession to Félix Fauré by 483 votes as against 279 recorded
by Jules Méline, his only serious competitor. He was marked
out for fierce opposition and bitter insult as the representative
of that section of the Republican party which sought the revision
of the Dreyfus case. On the day of President Faure&rsquo;s funeral
Paul Déroulède met the troops under General Roget on their
return to barracks, and demanded that the general should march
on the Élysée. Roget sensibly took his troops back to barracks.
At the Auteuil steeplechase in June the president was struck
on the head with a cane by an anti-Dreyfusard. In that month
President Loubet summoned Waldeck-Rousseau to form a
cabinet, and at the same time entreated Republicans of all
shades of opinion to rally to the defence of the state. By the
efforts of Loubet and Waldeck-Rousseau the Dreyfus affair was
settled, when Loubet, acting on the advice of General Galliffet,
minister of war, remitted the ten years&rsquo; imprisonment to which
Dreyfus was condemned at Rennes. Loubet&rsquo;s presidency saw
an acute stage of the clerical question, which was attacked
by Waldeck-Rousseau and in still more drastic fashion by the
Combes ministry. The French ambassador was recalled from
the Vatican in April 1905, and in July the separation of church
and state was voted in the Chamber of Deputies. Feeling had
run high between France and England over the mutual
criticisms passed on the conduct of the South African War and
the Dreyfus case respectively. These differences were composed
by the Anglo-French <i>entente</i>, and in 1904 a convention between
the two countries secured the recognition of French claims in
Morocco in exchange for non-interference with the English
occupation of Egypt. President Loubet was a typical example
of the peasant-proprietor class, and had none of the aristocratic,
not to say monarchical, proclivities of President Fauré. He
inaugurated the Paris Exhibition of 1900, received the tsar
Nicholas II. in September 1901 and paid a visit to Russia in
1902. He also exchanged visits with King Edward VII.,
with the king of Italy and the king of Spain. The king of Spain&rsquo;s
visit in 1905 was the occasion of an attempt on his life, a bomb
being thrown under his carriage as he was proceeding with his
guest to the opera. His presidency came to an end in January
1906, when he retired into private life.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUDON, ERNST GIDEON,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> <span class="sc">Freiherr von</span> (1717-1790),
Austrian soldier, was born at Tootzen in Livonia, on the 2nd of
February 1717. His family, of Scottish origin,<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> had been settled
in that country since before 1400. His father was a lieutenant-colonel,
retired on a meagre pension from the Swedish service,
and the boy was sent in 1732 into the Russian army as a cadet.
He took part in Field Marshal Münnich&rsquo;s siege of Danzig in
1734, in the march of a Russian corps to the Rhine in 1735 and
in the Turkish war 1738-1739. Dissatisfied with his prospects
he resigned in 1741 and sought military employment elsewhere.
He applied first to Frederick the Great, who declined his services.
At Vienna he had better fortune, being made a captain in Trenck&rsquo;s
free corps. He took part in its forays and marches, though not
in its atrocities, until wounded and taken prisoner in Alsace.
He was shortly released by the advance of the main Austrian
army. His next active service, still under Trenck, was in the
Silesian mountains in 1745, in which campaign he greatly distinguished
himself as a leader of light troops. He was present
also at Soor. He retired shortly afterwards, owing to his distaste
for the lawless habits of his comrades in the irregulars, and after
long waiting in poverty for a regular commission he was at last
made a captain in one of the frontier regiments, spending the
next ten years in half-military, half-administrative work in the
Carlstadt district. At Bunich, where he was stationed, he built
a church and planted an oak forest now called by his name.
He had reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel when the outbreak
of the Seven Years&rsquo; War called him again into the field. From
this point began his fame as a soldier. Soon promoted colonel,
he distinguished himself repeatedly and was in 1757 made a
General-feldwacht-meister (major-general of cavalry) and a
knight of the newly founded order of Maria Theresa. In the
campaign of 1758 came his first opportunity for fighting an
action as a commander-in-chief, and he used it so well that
Frederick the Great was obliged to give up the siege of Olmütz
and retire into Bohemia (action of Dom-stadtl, 30th of June).
He was rewarded with the grade of lieutenant-field-marshal
and having again shown himself an active and daring commander
in the campaign of Hochkirch, he was created a Freiherr
in the Austrian nobility by Maria Theresa and in the peerage
of the Holy Roman Empire by her husband the emperor Francis.
Maria Theresa gave him, further, the grand cross of the order
she had founded and an estate near Kuttenberg in Bohemia.
He was placed in command of the Austrian contingent sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
join the Russians on the Oder. At Kunersdorf he turned defeat
into a brilliant victory, and was promoted Feldzeugmeister
and made commander-in-chief in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia.
In 1760 he destroyed a whole corps of Frederick&rsquo;s army under
Fouqué at Landshut and stormed the important fortress of
Glatz. In 1760 he sustained a reverse at Frederick&rsquo;s hands in the
battle of Liegnitz (Aug. 15th, 1760), which action led to bitter
controversy with Daun and Lacy, the commanders of the main
army, who, Loudon claimed, had left his corps unsupported.
In 1761 he operated, as usual, in Silesia, but he found his Russian
allies as timid as they had been after Kunersdorf, and all attempts
against Frederick&rsquo;s entrenched camp of Bunzelwitz (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seven
Years&rsquo; War</a></span>) failed. He brilliantly seized his one fleeting
opportunity, however, and stormed Schweidnitz on the night of
Sept. 30/October 1st, 1761. His tireless activity continued to the
end of the war, in conspicuous contrast with the temporizing
strategy of Daun and Lacy. The student of the later campaigns
of the Seven Years&rsquo; War will probably admit that there was
need of more aggressiveness than Daun displayed, and of more
caution than suited Loudon&rsquo;s genius. But neither recognized
this, and the last three years of the war are marked by an ever-increasing
friction between the &ldquo;Fabius&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Marcellus,&rdquo;
as they were called, of the Austrian army.</p>

<p>After the peace, therefore, when Daun became the virtual
commander-in-chief of the army, Loudon fell into the background.
Offers were made, by Frederick the Great amongst
others, to induce Loudon to transfer his services elsewhere.
Loudon did not entertain these proposals, although negotiations
went on for some years, and on Lacy succeeding Daun as president
of the council of war Loudon was made inspector-general of
infantry. Dissensions, however, continued between Loudon
and Lacy, and on the accession of Joseph II., who was intimate
with his rival, Loudon retired to his estate near Kuttenberg.
Maria Theresa and Kaunitz caused him, however, to be made
commander-in-chief in Bohemia and Moravia in 1769. This
post he held for three years, and at the end of this time, contemplating
retirement from the service, he settled again on his
estate. Maria Theresa once more persuaded him to remain in
the army, and, as his estate had diminished in value owing to
agrarian troubles in Bohemia, she repurchased it from him
(1776) on generous terms. Loudon then settled at Hadersdorf
near Vienna, and shortly afterwards was made a field-marshal.
Of this Carlyle (<i>Frederick the Great</i>) records that when Frederick
the Great met Loudon in 1776 he deliberately addressed him
in the emperor&rsquo;s presence as &ldquo;Herr Feldmarschall.&rdquo; But the
hint was not taken until February 1778.</p>

<p>In 1778 came the War of the Bavarian Succession. Joseph
and Lacy were now reconciled to Loudon, and Loudon and Lacy
commanded the two armies in the field. On this occasion,
however, Loudon seems to have in a measure fallen below his
reputation, while Lacy, who was opposed to Frederick&rsquo;s own
army, earned new laurels. For two years after this Loudon
lived quietly at Hadersdorf, and then the reverses of other
generals in the Turkish War called him for the last time into the
field. Though old and broken in health, he was commander-in-chief
in fact as well as in name, and he won a last brilliant success
by capturing Belgrade in three weeks, 1789. He died within the
year, on the 14th of July at Neu-Titschein in Moravia, still
on duty. His last appointment was that of commander-in-chief
of the armed forces of Austria, which had been created for him
by the new emperor Leopold. Loudon was buried in the grounds
of Hadersdorf. Eight years before his death the emperor
Joseph had caused a marble bust of this great soldier to be
placed in the chamber of the council of war.</p>

<p>His son <span class="sc">Johann Ludwig Alexius</span>, Freiherr von Loudon
(1762-1822) fought in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars
with credit, and rose to the rank of lieutenant-field-marshal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUDOUN, JOHN CAMPBELL,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (1598-1663),
Scottish politician, eldest son of Sir James Campbell of Lawers,
became Baron Loudoun in right of his wife Margaret, granddaughter
of Hugh Campbell, 1st Baron Loudoun (d. 1622). He
was created earl on the 12th of May 1633, but in consequence
of his opposition to Charles I.&rsquo;s church policy in Scotland the
patent was stopped in Chancery. In 1637 he was one of the
supplicants against the introduction of the English liturgy;
and with John Leslie, 6th earl of Rothes, he took a leading part
in the promulgation of the Covenant and in the General Assembly
which met at Glasgow in the autumn of 1638. He served under
General Leslie, and was one of the Scottish commissioners at the
Pacification of Berwick in June 1639. In November of that year
and again in 1640 the Scottish estates sent Loudoun with Charles
Seton, 2nd earl of Dunfermline, to London on an embassy to
Charles I. Loudoun intrigued with the French ambassador and
with Thomas Savile, afterwards earl of Sussex, but without much
success. He was in London when John Stewart, earl of Traquair,
placed in Charles&rsquo;s hands a letter signed by Loudoun and six
others and addressed to Louis XIII. In spite of his protest that
the letter was never sent, and that it would in any case be covered
by the amnesty granted at Berwick, he was sent to the Tower.
He was released in June, and two months later he re-entered
England with the Scottish invading army, and was one of the
commissioners at Ripon in October. In the following August
(1641) Charles opened parliament at Edinburgh in person, and
in pursuance of a policy of conciliation towards the leaders of the
Covenant Loudoun was made lord chancellor of Scotland, and
his title of earl of Loudoun was allowed. He also became first
commissioner of the treasury. In 1642 he was sent by the Scottish
council to York to offer to mediate in the dispute between
Charles and the parliament, and later on to Oxford, but in the
second of these instances Charles refused to accept his authority.
He was constantly employed in subsequent negotiations, and in
1647 was sent to Charles at Carisbrooke Castle, but the &ldquo;Engagement&rdquo;
to assist the king there made displeased the extreme
Covenanters, and Loudoun was obliged to retract his support of
it. He was now entirely on the side of the duke of Argyll and
the preachers. He assisted in the capacity of lord chancellor
at Charles II.&rsquo;s coronation at Scone, and was present at Dunbar.
He joined in the royalist rising of 1653, but eventually surrendered
to General Monk. His estates were forfeited by
Cromwell, and a sum of money settled on the countess and her
heirs. At the Restoration he was removed from the chancellorship,
but a pension of £1000 granted him by Charles I. in 1643
was still allowed him. In 1662 he was heavily fined. He died
in Edinburgh on the 15th of March 1663.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The earl&rsquo;s elder son, James (d. 1684), 2nd earl of Loudoun, passed
his life out of Great Britain, and when he died at Leiden was succeeded
by his son Hugh (d. 1731). The 3rd earl held various high
positions in England and Scotland, being chosen one of the representative
peers for Scotland at the union of the parliaments in 1707.
He rendered good service to the government during the rising of
1715, especially at the battle of Sheriffmuir, and was succeeded
as 4th earl by his son John (1705-1782), who fought against the
Jacobites in 1745, was commander-in-chief of the British force in
America in 1756 and died unmarried. The title then passed to
James Mure Campbell (d. 1786), a grandson of the 2nd earl, and was
afterwards borne by the marquesses of Hastings, descendants of the
5th earl&rsquo;s daughter and heiress, Flora (1780-1840). Again reverting
to a female on the death of Henry, 4th marquess of Hastings,
in 1868, it came afterwards to Charles (b. 1855), a nephew of this
marquess, who became 11th earl of Loudoun.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUDUN,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> a town of western France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Vienne, on an eminence overlooking
a fertile plain, 45 m. by rail S.W. of Tours. Pop. (1906) 3931.
It was formerly surrounded by walls, of which a single gateway
and two towers remain. Of the old castle of the counts of Anjou
which was destroyed under Richelieu, the site now forming a
public promenade, a fine rectangular donjon of the 12th century
is preserved; at its base traces of Roman constructions have
been found, with fragments of porphyry pavement, mosaics and
mural paintings. The Carmelite convent was the scene of the
trial of Urban Grandier, who was burnt alive for witchcraft in
1634; the old Romanesque church of Sainte Croix, of which he
was curé, is now used as a market. The church of St Pierre-du-Marché,
Gothic in style with a Renaissance portal, has a lofty
stone spire. There are several curious old houses in the town.

Théophraste Renaudot (d. 1653), founder of the <i>Gazette de France</i>,
was born at Loudun, where there is a statue of him. The manufacture
of lace and upholstery trimming and of farm implements
is carried on, and there is a considerable trade in agricultural
products, wine, &amp;c. Loudun (<i>Laudunum</i> in ancient times) was
a town of importance during the religious wars and gave its
name in 1616 to a treaty favourable to the Protestants.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUGHBOROUGH,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in
the Loughborough (Mid) parliamentary division of Leicestershire,
England, near the river Soar and on the Loughborough canal.
Pop. (1901) 21,508. It is 110 m. N.N.W. of London by the
Midland railway, and is served by the Great Central and a
branch of the London and North-Western railways. The neighbourhood
is a rich agricultural district, and to the S.W. lies
the hilly tract known as Charnwood Forest. The church of All
Saints stands on rising ground, and is a conspicuous object for
many miles round; it is of Decorated work, and the tower is
Perpendicular. The other churches are modern. Public buildings
include the town hall and exchange, town offices, county
hall and free library. The grammar school, founded in 1495
under the charity of Thomas Burton, occupies modern buildings
in pleasant grounds. There is also a girls&rsquo; grammar school partly
dependent on the same foundation. The principal industry is
hosiery making; there are also engineering, iron and dye works
and bell foundries. The great bell for St Paul&rsquo;s cathedral,
London, was cast here in 1881. Loughborough was incorporated
in 1888. Area, 3045 acres.</p>

<p>The manor of Loughborough (<i>Lucteburne</i>, <i>Lucteburg</i>, <i>Lughteburgh</i>)
was granted by William the Conqueror to Hugh Lupus,
from whom it passed to the Despensers. In 1226-1227 when it
belonged to Hugh Despenser he obtained various privileges for
himself and his men and tenants there, among which were
quittance from suits at the county and hundred courts, of sheriffs&rsquo;
aids and of view of frankpledge, and also a market every Thursday
and a fair on the vigil, day and morrow of St Peter ad vincula.
The market rights were purchased by the town in 1880 from the
trustees of Thomas Cradock, late lord of the manor. Edward II.
visited the manor several times when it belonged to his favourite,
Hugh Despenser the elder. Among the subsequent lords were
Henry de Beaumont and Alice his wife, Sir Edward Hastings,
created Baron Hastings of Loughborough in 1558, Colonel Henry
Hastings, created baron in 1645, and the earls of Huntingdon.
Alexander Wedderburn was created Baron Loughborough in
1780 when he became chief justice of the common pleas. During
the 19th century most of the manorial rights were purchased by
the local board. Loughborough was at first governed by a bailiff,
afterwards by a local board, and was finally incorporated in 1888
under a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. It has never been
represented in parliament. Lace-making was formerly the chief
industry, but machines for making lace set up in the town by John
Heathcote were destroyed by the Luddites in 1816, and the
manufacture lost its importance. Bell-founding was introduced
in 1840. John Cleveland, the Royalist poet, was born at
Loughborough in 1613, John Howe the painter in 1630 and
Richard Pulteney the botanist in 1730.</p>

pleasantly situated on the N. shore of Lough Rea, 116 m. W. from
Dublin by a branch from Attymon Junction on the Midland
Great Western railway. Pop. (1901), 2815. There are slight
remains of an Early English Carmelite friary dating <i>c.</i> 1300, which
escaped the Dissolution. Loughrea is the seat of the Roman
Catholic bishop of Clonfert, and has a cathedral built in 1900-1905.
A part of the castle of Richard de Burgh, the founder of
the friary, still survives, and there are traces of the town fortifications.

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS I.<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (778-840), surnamed the &ldquo;Pious,&rdquo; Roman emperor,
third son of the emperor Charlemagne and his wife Hildegarde,
was born at Chasseneuil in central France, and crowned king of
Aquitaine in 781. He received a good education; but as his
tastes were ecclesiastical rather than military, the government
of his kingdom was mainly conducted by his counsellors. Louis,
however, gained sound experience in warfare in the defence of
Aquitaine, shared in campaigns against the Saxons and the Avars,
and led an army to Italy in 792. In 794 or 795 he married
Irmengarde, daughter of Ingram, count of Haspen. After the
deaths of his two elder brothers, Louis, at his father&rsquo;s command,
crowned himself co-emperor at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 11th of
September 813, and was formally associated in the government
of the Empire, of which he became sole ruler, in the following
January. He earned the surname of &ldquo;Pious&rdquo; by banishing
his sisters and others of immoral life from court; by attempting
to reform and purify monastic life; and by showing great
liberality to the church. In October 816 he was crowned
emperor at Reims by Pope Stephen IV.; and at Aix in July
817, he arranged for a division of his Empire among his sons.
This was followed by a revolt of his nephew, Bernard, king of
Italy; but the rising was easily suppressed, and Bernard was
mutilated and killed. The emperor soon began to repent of
this cruelty, and when his remorse had been accentuated by the
death of his wife in 818, he pardoned the followers of Bernard
and restored their estates, and in 822 did public penance at
Attigny. In 819 he married Judith, daughter of Welf I., count
of Bavaria, who in 823 bore him a son Charles, afterwards
called the Bald. Judith made unceasing efforts to secure a
kingdom for her child; and with the support of her eldest
step-son Lothair, a district was carved out for Charles in 829.
Discontent at this arrangement increased to the point of rebellion,
which broke out the following year, provoked by Judith&rsquo;s intrigues
with Bernard, count of Barcelona, whom she had installed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
as her favourite at court. Lothair and his brother Pippin joined
the rebels, and after Judith had been sent into a convent and
Bernard had fled to Spain, an assembly was held at Compiègne,
when Louis was practically deposed and Lothair became the
real ruler of the Empire. Sympathy was, however, soon aroused
for the emperor, who was treated as a prisoner, and a second
assembly was held at Nimwegen in October 830 when, with
the concurrence of his sons Pippin and Louis, he was restored to
power and Judith returned to court.</p>

<p>Further trouble between Pippin and his father led to the
nominal transfer of Aquitaine from Pippin to his brother
Charles in 831. The emperor&rsquo;s plans for a division of his
dominions then led to a revolt of his three sons. Louis met them
in June 833 near Kolmar, but owing possibly to the influence
of Pope Gregory IV., who took part in the negotiations, he found
himself deserted by his supporters, and the treachery and
falsehood which marked the proceedings gave to the place the
name of <i>Lügenfeld</i>, or the &ldquo;field of lies.&rdquo; Judith, charged
with infidelity, was again banished; Louis was sent into the
monastery of St Medard at Soissons; and the government of
the Empire was assumed by his sons. The emperor was forced
to confess his sins, and declare himself unworthy of the throne,
but Lothair did not succeed in his efforts to make his father
a monk. Sympathy was again felt for Louis, and when the
younger Louis had failed to induce Lothair to treat the emperor
in a more becoming fashion, he and Pippin took up arms on
behalf of their father. The result was that in March 834 Louis
was restored to power at St Denis; Judith once more returned
to his side and the kingdoms of Louis and Pippin were increased.
The struggle with Lothair continued until the autumn, when
he submitted to the emperor and was confined to Italy. To
make the restoration more complete, a great assembly at Diedenhofen
declared the deposition of Louis to have been contrary
to law, and a few days later he was publicly restored in the
cathedral of Metz. In December 838 Pippin died, and a new
arrangement was made by which the Empire, except Bavaria,
the kingdom of Louis, was divided between Lothair, now
reconciled to his father, and Charles. The emperor was returning
from suppressing a revolt on the part of his son Louis, provoked
by this disposition, when he died on the 20th of June 840 on an
island in the Rhine near Ingelheim. He was buried in the church
of St Arnulf at Metz. Louis was a man of strong frame, who
loved the chase, and did not shrink from the hardships of war.
He was, however, easily influenced and was unequal to the government
of the Empire bequeathed to him by his father. No
sustained effort was made to ward off the inroads of the Danes
and others, who were constantly attacking the borders of the
Empire. Louis, who is also called <i>Le Débonnaire</i>, counts as
Louis I., king of France.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS II.<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (825-875), Roman emperor, eldest son of the emperor
Lothair I., was designated king of Italy in 839, and taking up
his residence in that country was crowned king at Rome by Pope
Sergius II. on the 15th of June 844. He at once preferred a
claim to the rights of an emperor in the city, which was decisively
rejected; but in 850 he was crowned joint emperor at Rome
by Pope Leo IV., and soon afterwards married his cousin, Engelberga,
a daughter of King Louis the German, and undertook the
independent government of Italy. He took the field against
the Saracens; quashed some accusations against Pope Leo;
held a diet at Pavia; and on the death of his father in September
855 became sole emperor. The division of Lothair&rsquo;s dominions,
by which he obtained no territory outside Italy, aroused his
discontent, and in 857 he allied himself with Louis the German
against his brother Lothair, king of Lorraine, and King Charles
the Bald. But after Louis had secured the election of Nicholas
I. as pope in 858, he became reconciled with his brother, and
received some lands south of the Jura in return for assistance
given to Lothair in his efforts to obtain a divorce from his wife,
Teutberga. In 863, on the death of his brother Charles, Louis
received the kingdom of Provence, and in 864 came into collision
with Pope Nicholas I. over his brother&rsquo;s divorce. The archbishops,
who had been deposed by Nicholas for proclaiming this
marriage invalid, obtained the support of the emperor, who
reached Rome with an army in February 864; but, having
been seized with fever, he made peace with the pope and left
the city. In his efforts to restore order in Italy, Louis met
with considerable success both against the turbulent princes
of the peninsula and against the Saracens who were ravaging
southern Italy. In 866 he routed these invaders, but could not
follow up his successes owing to the want of a fleet. So in
869 he made an alliance with the eastern emperor, Basil I.,
who sent him some ships to assist in the capture of Bari, the
headquarters of the Saracens, which succumbed in 871. Meanwhile
his brother Lothair had died in 869, and owing to his
detention in southern Italy he was unable to prevent the partition
of Lorraine between Louis the German and Charles the Bald.
Some jealousy between Louis and Basil followed the victory
at Bari, and in reply to an insult from the eastern emperor
Louis attempted to justify his right to the title &ldquo;emperor of
the Romans.&rdquo; He had withdrawn into Benevento to prepare
for a further campaign, when he was treacherously attacked
in his palace, robbed and imprisoned by Adelchis, prince of
Benevento, in August 871. The landing of fresh bands of
Saracens compelled Adelchis to release his prisoner a month
later, and Louis was forced to swear he would take no revenge
for this injury, nor ever enter Benevento with an army. Returning
to Rome, he was released from his oath, and was crowned a
second time as emperor by Pope Adrian II. on the 18th of May
872. He won further successes against the Saracens, who were
driven from Capua, but the attempts of the emperor to punish
Adelchis were not very successful. Returning to northern Italy,
he died, somewhere in the province of Brescia, on the 12th of
August 875, and was buried in the church of St Ambrose at Milan,
having named as his successor in Italy his cousin Carloman,
son of Louis the German. Louis was an excellent ruler, of
whom it was said &ldquo;in his time there was great peace, because
every one could enjoy his own possessions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS III.<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 880-928), surnamed the &ldquo;Blind,&rdquo; Roman
emperor, was a son of Boso, king of Provence or Lower Burgundy,
and Irmengarde, daughter of the emperor Louis II. The
emperor Charles the Fat took Louis under his protection on the
death of Boso in 887; but Provence was in a state of wild
disorder, and it was not until 890, when Irmengarde had secured
the support of the Bavarian king Arnulf and of Pope Stephen V.,
that Louis was recognized as king. In 900, after the death of
the emperor Arnulf, he went to Italy to obtain the imperial
crown. He was chosen king of the Lombards at Pavia, and
crowned emperor at Rome in February 901 by Pope Benedict IV.
He gained a temporary authority in northern Italy, but was
soon compelled by his rival Berengar, margrave of Friuli, to
leave the country and to swear he would never return. In
spite of his oath he went again to Italy in 904, where he secured
the submission of Lombardy; but on the 21st of July 905 he
was surprised at Verona by Berengar, who deprived him of his
sight and sent him back to Provence, where he passed his days
in enforced inactivity until his death in September 928. He
married Adelaide, possibly a daughter of Rudolph I., king of
Upper Burgundy. His eldest son, Charles Constantine, succeeded
to no more than the county of Vienne.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS IV.,<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> or <span class="bold">V.</span> (<i>c.</i> 1287-1347), surnamed the Bavarian,
Roman emperor and duke of Upper Bavaria, was the second
son of Louis II., duke of Upper Bavaria and count palatine of
the Rhine, and Matilda, daughter of the German king Rudolph
I. Having lost his father in 1294 he inherited, jointly with
his elder brother Rudolph, Upper Bavaria and the Palatinate,
but passed his time mainly at the court of the Habsburgs in
Vienna, while his early experiences of warfare were gained in
the campaigns of his uncle, the German king Albert I. He was
soon at variance with his brother over their joint possessions.
Albert taking the part of Louis in this quarrel, Rudolph promised
in 1301 to admit his brother to a share in the government of
Bavaria and the Palatinate. When Albert was murdered in
May 1308, Louis became a candidate for the German throne;
but his claim was not strongly supported. The new king,
Henry VII., was very friendly with Rudolph, and as the promise
of 1301 had not been carried out, Louis demanded a partition
of their lands. Upper Bavaria was accordingly divided in 1310,
and Louis received the north-western part of the duchy; but
Rudolph refused to surrender any part of the Palatinate. In
1310, on the death of Stephen I., duke of Lower Bavaria, Louis
undertook the guardianship of his two young sons. This led
to a war between the brothers, which lasted till June 1313, when
peace was made at Munich. Many of the nobles in Lower Bavaria,
however, angered at Louis, called in the aid of Frederick I.
(the Fair), duke of Austria; but he was defeated at Gammelsdorf
on the 9th of November 1313, a victory which not only led to
peace, but conferred considerable renown on Louis.</p>

<p>In August 1313 the German throne had again become vacant,
and Louis was chosen at Frankfort on the 20th of October 1314
by a majority of the electors, and his coronation followed at
Aix-la-Chapelle on the 25th of November. A minority of princes
had, however, supported Frederick of Austria; and a war
followed between the rivals, during which Louis was supported
by the cities and the districts of the middle and lower Rhine.
His embarrassments were complicated by a renewal of the
dispute with his brother; but when this had been disposed of
in 1317 by Rudolph&rsquo;s renunciation of his claims on upper Bavaria
and the Palatinate in consideration of a yearly subsidy, Louis
was able to give undivided attention to the war with Frederick,
and obtained several fresh allies. On the 28th of September
1322 a battle was fought at Mühldorf, which ended in a complete
victory for Louis, owing mainly to the timely aid of Frederick IV.
of Hohenzollern, burgrave of Nüremburg. Frederick of Austria
was taken prisoner, but the struggle was continued by his brother
Leopold until the latter&rsquo;s death in 1326. Attempts to enable
the two kings to rule Germany jointly failed, and about 1326
Frederick returned to Austria, leaving Louis in undisputed possession
of the country. Before this conclusion, however, a new
enemy had taken the field. Supported by Philip V. of France
in his desire to free Italy entirely from German influence, Pope
John XXII. refused to recognize either Frederick or Louis, and
asserted his own right to administer the empire during a vacancy.
After the battle of Mühldorf Louis sent Berthold of Neifen,
count of Marstetten, into Italy with an army, which soon compelled
the papal troops to raise the siege at Milan. The pope
threatened Louis with excommunication unless he resigned his
kingdom within three months. The king thereupon appealed
to a general council, and was placed under the papal ban on
the 23rd of March 1324, a sentence which he answered by publishing
his charges against the pope. In the contest Louis was
helped by the Minorites, who were upholding against John
the principal of clerical poverty, and by the writings of Marsilius
of Padua (who dedicated to Louis his <i>Defensor pacis</i>), William of
Occam, John of Jandun and others. Taking the offensive,
Louis met his Ghibelline supporters at Trent and reached Italy
in March 1327; and in May he received the Lombard crown
at Milan. Although the pope renewed his fulminations Louis
compelled Pisa to surrender, and was hailed with great rejoicing
in Rome. On the 17th of January 1328 he was crowned
emperor in St Peter&rsquo;s by Sciarra Colonna, a Roman noble; and
he answered the continued attacks of Pope John by pronouncing
his deposition, and proclaiming Peter of Corvara pope as Nicholas
V. He then undertook an expedition against John&rsquo;s ally, Robert,
king of Naples, but, disunion among his troops and scarcity
of money and provisions, drove him again to Rome, where,
finding that his exactions had diminished his popularity, he left
the city, and after passing six months at Pisa, returned to
Germany in January 1330. The struggle with the pope was
renewed in Germany, and when a formidable league had been
formed against Louis, his thoughts turned to a reconciliation.
He was prepared to assent to very humiliating terms, and even
agreed to abdicate; but the negotiations, which were prolonged
by further demands on the part of the pope, were interrupted
by his death in December 1334. John&rsquo;s successor, Benedict
XII., seemed more anxious to come to an arrangement, but was
prevented from doing so by the influence of Philip VI. of France.
Overtures for peace were made to Philip, but without success;
and in July 1337 Louis concluded an alliance with Edward
III., king of England, and made active preparations for war.
During these years his attention was also occupied by a quarrel
with John, king of Bohemia, over the possession of Tirol, by a
campaign in Lower Bavaria, and a futile expedition against
Nicholas I., bishop of Constance. But although his position
was shaken by the indifferent success which attended these
campaigns, it was improved when the electors meeting at Rense
in July 1338 banded themselves together to defend their elective
rights, and when the diet at Frankfort confirmed a decree which
declared that the German king did not need the papal approbation
to make his election valid.</p>

<p>Louis devoted considerable thought and time to extending
the possessions of the Wittelsbach family, to which he belonged.
Tirol had for some time been a subject of contention between
the emperor and other princes. The heiress of this county,
Margaret Maultasch, had married John Henry, margrave of
Moravia, son of King John of Bohemia. Having quarrelled
with her husband, Margaret fled to the protection of Louis, who
seized the opportunity to declare her marriage void and to unite
her in 1342 with his son Louis. The emperor also increased his
possessions by his own marriage. In 1322 his first wife, Beatrice,
daughter of Henry III., count of Glogau, had died after thirteen
years of married life, and Louis then married Margaret, daughter
of William III., count of Holland. When her brother, count
William IV., died childless in 1345, the emperor obtained possession
of Holland, Zealand and Friesland. In 1341 he recovered
a portion of the Palatinate, and soon deserted Edward of England
and came to terms with Philip of France. The acquisition of the
territories, and especially of Tirol, had provided Louis with many
enemies, prominent among whom were John of Bohemia and his
family, that of Luxemburg. John, therefore, entered into an
alliance with Pope Clement VI. The course of the war which
ensued in Germany was such as to compel the emperor to submit
to humiliating terms, though he stopped short of accepting the
election of Charles, margrave of Moravia (afterwards the emperor
Charles IV.) as German king in July 1346. Charles consequently
attacked Tirol; but Louis, who appeared to have considerable
chances of success, died suddenly at a bear-hunt near Munich
on the 11th of October 1347. He was buried in the Frauenkirche
at Munich, where a statue was erected to his memory in 1622
by Maximilian I., elector of Bavaria, and where a second was
unveiled in 1905. He had seven sons, three of whom were subsequently
electors of Brandenburg, and ten daughters.</p>

<p>Various estimates have been formed of the character of Louis.
As a soldier he possessed skill as well as bravery, but he lacked
perseverance and decision in his political relations. At one
time haughtily defying the pope, at another abjectly craving his
pardon, he seems a very inglorious figure; and the fact that he
remained almost undisturbed in the possession of Germany
in spite of the utmost efforts of the popes, is due rather to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
political and intellectual tendencies of the time than to his own
good qualities. Nevertheless he ruled Bavaria with considerable
success. He befriended the towns, encouraged trade and
commerce and gave a new system of laws to the duchy. German
took the place of Latin in the imperial charters, and although
not a scholar, the emperor was a patron of learning. Louis was
a man of graceful appearance, with ruddy countenance and
prominent nose.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (804-876) surnamed the &ldquo;German,&rdquo; king of the
East Franks, was the third son of the emperor Louis I. and his
wife Irmengarde. His early years were partly spent at the
court of his grandfather Charlemagne, whose special affection
he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis divided his
dominions between his sons in 817, Louis received Bavaria and
the neighbouring lands, but did not undertake the government
until 825, when he became involved in war with the Slavonic
tribes on his eastern frontier. In 827 he married Emma, daughter
of Welf I., count of Bavaria, and sister of his stepmother Judith;
and he soon began to interfere in the quarrels arising from
Judith&rsquo;s efforts to secure a kingdom for her own son Charles,
and the consequent struggles of Louis and his brothers with the
emperor Louis I. (<i>q.v.</i>). When the elder Louis died in 840 and
his eldest son Lothair claimed the whole Empire, Louis in alliance
with his half-brother, king Charles the Bald, defeated Lothair
at Fontenoy on the 25th of June 841. In June 842 the three
brothers met on an island in the Sâone to negotiate a peace, and
each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries
of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the treaty
of Verdun concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the
bulk of the lands of the Carolingian empire lying east of the Rhine,
together with a district around Spires, Worms and Mainz, on
the left bank of the river. His territories included Bavaria,
where he made Regensburg the centre of his government,
Thuringia, Franconia and Saxony. He may truly be called the
founder of the German kingdom, though his attempts to maintain
the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842
crushed a rising in Saxony, he compelled the Abotrites to own
his authority, and undertook campaigns against the Bohemians,
the Moravians and other tribes, but was not very successful
in freeing his shores from the ravages of Danish pirates. At his
instance synods and assemblies were held where laws were
decreed for the better government of church and state. In 853
and the following years Louis made more than one attempt
to secure the throne of Aquitaine, which the people of that
country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of
Charles the Bald. But though he met with sufficient success
to encourage him to issue a charter in 858, dated &ldquo;the first
year of the reign in West Francia,&rdquo; treachery and desertion
in his army, and the loyalty to Charles of the Aquitanian
bishops brought about the failure of the enterprise, which
Louis renounced by a treaty signed at Coblenz on the 7th of
June 860.</p>

<p>In 855 the emperor Lothair died, and was succeeded in Italy by
his eldest son Louis II., and in the northern part of his kingdom
by his second son, Lothair. The comparative weakness of these
kingdoms, together with the disorder caused by the matrimonial
troubles of Lothair, afforded a suitable opening for the intrigues
of Louis and Charles the Bald, whose interest was increased by
the fact that both their nephews were without male issue.
Louis supported Lothair in his efforts to divorce his wife
Teutberga, for which he received a promise of Alsace, while Charles
opposed the divorce. But in 865 Louis and Charles meeting
near Toul, renewed the peace of Coblenz, and doubtless discussed
the possibility of dividing Lothair&rsquo;s kingdom. In 868 at Metz
they agreed definitely to a partition; but when Lothair died in
869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged
with the Moravians. Charles the Bald accordingly seized the
whole kingdom; but Louis, having recovered, compelled him
by a threat of war to agree to the treaty of Mersen, which divided
it between the claimants. The later years of Louis were troubled
by risings on the part of his sons, the eldest of whom, Carloman,
revolted in 861 and again two years later; an example that
was followed by the second son Louis, who in a further rising
was joined by his brother Charles. A report that the emperor
Louis II. was dead led to peace between father and sons. The
emperor, however, was not dead, but a prisoner; and as he was
not only the nephew, but also the son-in-law of Louis, that
monarch hoped to secure both the imperial dignity and the Italian
kingdom for his son Carloman. Meeting his daughter Engelberga,
the wife of Louis II., at Trent in 872, Louis made an alliance with
her against Charles the Bald, and in 874 visited Italy doubtless
on the same errand. The emperor, having named Carloman
as his successor, died in August 875, but Charles the Bald
reached Italy before his rival, and by persuading Carloman,
when he did cross the Alps, to return, secured the imperial crown.
Louis was preparing for war when he died on the 28th of
September 876 at Frankfort, and was buried at Lorsch, leaving
three sons and three daughters. Louis was in war and peace
alike, the most competent of the descendants of Charlemagne.
He obtained for his kingdom a certain degree of security in face
of the attacks of Normans, Hungarians, Moravians and others.
He lived in close alliance with the Church, to which he was
very generous, and entered eagerly into schemes for the conversion
of his heathen neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS I.,<a name="ar72a" id="ar72a"></a></span> king of Bavaria (1786-1868), son of the then prince,
afterwards duke and elector, Max Joseph of Zweibrücken and his
wife Princess Augusta of Hesse-Darmstadt (&emsp;&emsp;-1796), was born
at Strassburg on the 25th of August 1786. He received a careful
education at home, afterwards (in 1803) going to the Bavarian
national university of Landshut and to Göttingen. As a young
man he was drawn into the Romantic movement then at its
height; but both the classics and contemporary classical poetry
took hold upon his receptive mind (he visited Goethe in 1827).
He had himself strong artistic tendencies, though his numerous
poems show but little proof of this, and as a patron of the
arts he proved himself as great as any who had ever occupied a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
German, throne, and more than a mere dilettante. His first visit
to Italy, in 1804, had an important influence upon this side of
his development.</p>

<p>But even in Italy the crown prince (his father had become
elector in 1799 and king of Bavaria in 1805) did not forget his
nationality. He soon made himself leader of the small anti-French
party in Bavaria. Napoleon sought in vain to win him
over, and Louis fell more and more out of favour with him.
Napoleon was even reported to have said: &ldquo;Qui m&rsquo;empêche
de laisser fusiller ce prince?&rdquo; Their relations continued to be
strained, although in the campaigns of 1807 and 1809, in which
Bavaria was among the allies of France, Louis won his laurels
in the field.</p>

<p>The crown prince was also averse from a Napoleonic marriage,
and preferred to marry (October 12, 1810) the Princess Therese
of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1792-1854). Three daughters and
four sons were born of this marriage, one of whom succeeded
him as Maximilian II., while another, Luitpold, became prince
regent of Bavaria on the death of Louis II.</p>

<p>During the time that he was crown prince Louis resided chiefly
at Innsbruck or Salzburg as governor of the circle of the Inn and
Salzach. In 1815 he attended the Congress of Vienna, where he
was especially occupied in endeavouring to obtain the restoration
of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany; and later in the year he
was with the allies in Paris, using his influence to secure the
return of the art treasures carried off by the French.</p>

<p>After 1815 also the crown prince maintained his anti-French
attitude, and it was mainly his influence that in 1817 secured the
fall of Montgelas, the minister with French sympathies. Opposed
to absolutism, Louis took great interest in the work of organizing
the Bavarian constitution (1818) and defended it against Metternich
and the Carlsbad Decrees (1819); he was also one of the
most zealous of the ardent Philhellenes in Germany at the time.
He succeeded to the crown of Bavaria on the 12th of October
1825, and at once embarked upon a moderate constitutional
policy, in which he found himself in general agreement with the
parliament. Although he displayed a loyal attachment to the
Catholic Church, especially owing to his artistic sympathies,
he none the less opposed all its more exaggerated pretensions,
especially as represented by the Jesuits, whom he condemned
as un-German. In the year of his accession he abolished an old
edict concerning the censorship. He also furthered in many ways
the internal administration of the state, and especially that of
the finances. His personal tastes, apart from his activities as a
Maecenas, being economical, he endeavoured also to limit public
expenditure, in a way which was not always a benefit to the
country. Bavaria&rsquo;s power of self-defence especially was
weakened by his economies and by his lack of interest in the
military aspect of things.</p>

<p>He was a warm friend of learning, and in 1826 transferred the
university of Landshut to Munich, where he placed it under his
special protection. Prominent scholars were summoned to it,
mostly belonging to the Romantic School, such as Goerres,
Schubert and Schelling, though others were not discouraged.
In the course of his visits to Italy he formed friendships with
famous artists such as Thorwaldsen and Cornelius. He was
especially anxious to obtain works of art, mainly sculpture,
for the famous Munich collections which he started, and in this
he had the advantage of the assistance of the painter Martin
Wagner. He also set on foot movements for excavation and the
collection of works of art in Greece, with excellent results.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the July revolution of 1830, however,
he also began to be drawn into the current of reaction; and
though he still declared himself openly against absolutism, and
never took up such a hostile attitude towards constitutional ideas
as his brother-in-law King Frederick William IV., he allowed
the reactionary system of surveillance which commended itself
to the German Confederation after 1830 to be introduced into
Bavaria (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bavaria</a></span>: <i>History</i>). He continued, on the other
hand, to do much for the economic development of the country.
As a follower of the ideas of Friedrich List, he furthered
the foundation of the Zollverein in the year 1833 and the
making of canals. Railways he looked upon as a &ldquo;necessary
evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In external politics peace was maintained on the whole after
1825. Temporary diplomatic complications arose between
Bavaria and Baden in connexion with Louis&rsquo;s favourite project
of winning back the part then belonging to Baden of the old
Palatinate, the land of his birth, which was always very dear to
him.</p>

<p>Of European importance was his enthusiasm for the liberation
of Greece from the rule of Turkey. Not only did he erect the
<i>Propyläen</i> at Munich in her honour, but he also helped her in the
most generous way both with money and diplomatic resources.
And after his second son Otto had become king of Greece in 1832,
Greek affairs became from time to time the central point of his
foreign policy. In 1835 he made a visit to Greece, partly political,
partly inspired by his old interest in art. But his son proved
unequal to his task, and in 1862 was forced to abdicate (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Otho, king of Greece</a></span>). For this unfortunate issue Louis was
not without blame; for from the very first, owing to an
exaggerated idealism and love of antiquity, he had totally
misunderstood the national character of the Greeks and the
problems involved in the attempts to govern them by bureaucratic
methods.</p>

<p>In Bavaria, too, his government became more and more conservative,
especially after Karl Abel became the head of the
ministry in 1837. The king had not yet, it is true, altogether
committed himself to the clerical ultras, and on the occasion of
the dispute about the bishops in Prussia in the same year had
taken up a wise attitude of compromise. But in Bavaria itself
the strict Catholic party influenced affairs more and more
decisively. For a while, indeed, this opposition did not impair
the king&rsquo;s popularity, due to his amiable character, his extraordinary
services in beautifying his capital of Munich, and to his
benevolence (it has been reckoned that he personally received
about 10,000 letters asking for help every year, and that the
money he devoted to charity amounted to about a fifth of his
income). The year 1846, however, brought a change which had
sad consequences. This was due to the king&rsquo;s relations with the
Spanish dancer Lola Montez, who appeared in Munich in October
1846, and soon succeeded by her beauty and wit in fascinating
the king, who was always susceptible to feminine charms. The
political importance of this lay in the fact that the royal mistress
began to use her great influence against the clerical policy of the
Abel ministry. So when the king was preparing the way for
ennobling her, in order to introduce her into court circles, which
were unwilling to receive her, the ministry protested in the
famous memorandum of the 11th of February 1847 against the
king&rsquo;s demand for her naturalization as a Bavarian, the necessary
preliminary to her ennoblement. The position was still further
embittered by the fact that, owing to an indiscretion, the
memorandum became known to the public. Thereupon the king,
irritated and outraged, replaced Abel&rsquo;s Clerical ministry by a
more accommodating Liberal one under Zu Rhein under which
Lola Montez without more difficulty became Countess Landsberg.
Meanwhile, the criticism and opposition of the people, and
especially of the students, was turned against the new leader of
the court of Munich. On top of this came the revolutionary
movement of 1848. The king&rsquo;s position became more and more
difficult, and under the pressure of popular opposition he was
forced to banish the countess. But neither this nor the king&rsquo;s
liberal proclamation of the 6th of March succeeded in establishing
peace, and in the capital especially the situation became
increasingly threatening. All this made such a deep impression
on the king, that on the 20th of March 1848 he abdicated in
favour of his son Maximilian.</p>

<p>He now retired entirely into private life, and continued
to play the Maecenas magnificently, frequently staying at his
villa in Rome, the Villa Malta, and enjoying extraordinary
vigour of mind and body up to the end of his days. His popularity,
which had been shaken by the Montez affair, he soon
recovered, especially among artists. To him Munich owes her
finest art collections and most remarkable buildings. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
monarch&rsquo;s artistic sense led him not only to adorn his house
with a number of works of antique art, but also to study German
medieval art, which he did to good effect. To him Munich owes
the acquisition of the famous Rhenish collection of the Boisserée
brothers. The king also worked with great zeal for the care
of monuments, and the cathedrals of Spires and Cologne enjoyed
his special care. He was also an unfailing supporter of
contemporary painting, in so far as it responded to his romantic
tendencies, and he gave a fresh impulse to the arts of working
in metal and glass. As visible signs of his permanent services
to art Munich possesses the Walhalla, the Glyptothek, the two
Pinakotheken, the Odeon, the University, and many other
magnificent buildings both sacred and profane. The rôle which
the Bavarian capital now plays as the leading art centre of Germany
would have been an impossibility without the splendid
munificence of Louis I.</p>

<p>He died on the 28th of February 1868 at Nice, and on the
9th of March was buried in Munich, amid demonstrations of
great popular feeling.</p>

<p>The chief part of Louis&rsquo;s records is contained in seven sealed
chests in the archives of his family, and by the provisions of
his will these were not to be opened till the year 1918. These
records contain an extraordinarily large and valuable mass of
historical material, including, as one item, 246 volumes of the
king&rsquo;s diary.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS II.,<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> king of Bavaria (1845-1886), son of his predecessor
Maximilian II. and his wife Maria, daughter of Prince William
of Prussia, was born at Nymphenburg on the 25th of August
1845. Together with his brother Otto, three years younger
than himself, Louis received, in accordance with the wishes
of his learned father, a simple and serious education modelled
on that of the German <i>Gymnasien</i>, of which the classical languages
are the chief feature. Of modern languages the crown prince
learnt only French, of which he remained fond all his life. The
practical value of the prince&rsquo;s training was small. It was not
till he was eighteen years old that he received his first pocket-money,
and at that age he had no ideas about money and its
value. Military instruction, physical exercises and sport, in
spite of the crown prince&rsquo;s strong physique, received little
attention. Thus Louis did not come enough into contact with
young men of his own age, and consequently soon developed
a taste for solitude, which was found at an early age to be combined
with the romantic tendencies and musical and theatrical
tastes traditional in his family.</p>

<p>Louis succeeded to the throne on the 10th of March 1864,
at the age of eighteen. The early years of his reign were marked
by a series of most serious political defeats for Bavaria. In the
Schleswig-Holstein question, though he was opposed to Prussia
and a friend of Duke Frederick VIII. of Augustenburg, he did
not command the material forces necessary effectively to resist
the powerful policy of Bismarck. Again, in the war of 1866,
Louis and his minister von der Pfordten took the side of Austria,
and at the conclusion of peace (August 22) Bavaria had, in
addition to the surrender of certain small portions of her territory,
to agree to the foundation of the North German Confederation
under the leadership of Prussia. The king&rsquo;s Bavarian patriotism,
one of the few steadfast ideas underlying his policy, was deeply
wounded by these occurrences, but he was face to face with the
inevitable, and on the 10th of August wrote a letter of reconciliation
to King William of Prussia. The defeat of Bavaria in 1866
showed clearly the necessity for a reform of the army. Under
the new Liberal ministry of Hohenlohe (December 29, 1866&mdash;February
13, 1870) and under Prauckh as minister of war, a
series of reforms were carried through which prepared for the
victories of 1870. As regards his ecclesiastical policy, though
Louis remained personally true to the Catholic Church, he strove
for a greater independence of the Vatican. He maintained
friendly relations with Ignaz von Döllinger, the leader of the
more liberal Catholics who opposed the definition of papal
infallibility, but without extending his protection to the anti-Roman
movement of the Old Catholics. In spite of this the
Old Bavarian opposition was so aroused by the Liberalism
of the Hohenlohe ministry that at the beginning of 1870 Louis
had to form a more Conservative cabinet under Count Bray-Steinburg.
On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War he
at once took the side of Prussia, and gave orders for mobilization.
In 1871 it was he who offered the imperial crown to the king
of Prussia; but this was not done on his own initiative. Bismarck
not only determined the king of Bavaria to take the
decisive step which put an end to a serious diplomatic crisis,
but actually drafted the letter to King William which Louis
copied and despatched without changing a word. Louis placed
very few difficulties in the way of the new German Empire under
the leadership of Prussia, though his Bavarian particularism
remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Though up till the beginning of the year 1880 he did not
cease to give some attention to state affairs, the king&rsquo;s interests
lay in quite other spheres. His personal idiosyncrasies had,
in fact, developed meanwhile in a most unhappy direction. His
enthusiasm for all that is beautiful soon led him into dangerous
bypaths. It found its most innocent expression in the earliest
years of his reign when he formed an intimate friendship with
Richard Wagner, whom from May 1864 to December 1865
he had constantly in his company. Louis was entirely possessed
by the soaring ideas of the master, and was energetic in their
realization. He not only established Wagner&rsquo;s material position
at the moment by paying 18,000 gulden of debts for him and
granting him a yearly income of 4000 gulden (afterwards increased
to 8000), but he also proceeded to realize the ambitious
artistic plans of the master. A series of brilliant model performances
of the Wagnerian music-dramas was instituted in
Munich under the personal patronage of the king, and when
the further plan of erecting a great festival theatre in Munich
for the performance of Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;music of the future&rdquo; broke
down in the face of the passive resistance of the local circles
interested, the royal enthusiast conceived the idea of building
at Bayreuth, according to Wagner&rsquo;s new principles, a theatre
worthy of the music-dramas. For a time Louis was entirely
under Wagner&rsquo;s influence, the fantastic tendencies of whose
art cast a spell over him, and there is extant a series of emotional
letters of the king to Wagner. Wagner, on the whole, used his
influence in artistic and not in political affairs.<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In spite of this
the opposition to him became permanent. Public opinion
in Bavaria for the most part turned against him. He was
attacked for his foreign origin, his extravagance, his intrigues,
his artistic utopias, and last but by no means least, for his
unwholesome influence over the king. Louis in the end was
compelled to give him up. But the relations between king
and artist were by no means at an end. In face of the war
which was imminent in 1866, and in the midst of the preparation
for war, the king hastened in May to Triebschen, near Lucerne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
in order to see Wagner again.<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In 1868 they were seen together
in public for the last time at the festival performances in Munich.
In 1876 Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Ring des Nibelungen</i> was performed for the
first time at Bayreuth in the presence of the king. Later, in
1881, the king formed a similar friendship with Joseph Kainz
the actor, but it soon came to an end. In January 1867 the
young king became betrothed to Duchess Sophie of Bavaria
(afterwards Duchesse d&rsquo;Alençon), daughter of Duke Max and
sister of the empress of Austria; but the betrothal was dissolved
in October of the same year.</p>

<p>Though even in his later years he remained interested in lofty
and intellectual pursuits, as may be gathered, apart from his
enthusiasm for art and nature, from his wide reading in history,
serious poetry and philosophy, yet in his private life there became
increasingly marked the signs of moral and mental weakness
which gradually gained the mastery over his once pure and noble
nature. A prominent feature was his blind craving for solitude.
He cut himself off from society, and avoided all intercourse
with his family, even with his devotedly affectionate mother.
With his ministers he came to communicate in writing only.
At the end he was surrounded only by inferior favourites and
servants. His life was now spent almost entirely in his castles
far from the capital, which irked him more and more, or in short
and hasty journeys, in which he always travelled incognito.
Even the theatre he could now only enjoy alone. He arranged
private performances in his castles or in Munich at fabulous
cost, and appointed an official poet to his household. Later
his avoidance of society developed into a dread of it, accompanied
by a fear of assassination and delusions that he was
being followed.</p>

<p>Side by side with this pathological development his inborn
self-consciousness increased apace, turning more and more to
megalomania, and impelling the weak-willed monarch to those
extraordinary displays of magnificence which can still be admired
to-day in the castles built or altered by him, such as Berg on
the Starnberger See, Linderhof, Herrenchiemsee, Hohenschwangau,
Neuschwanstein, &amp;c., which are among the most splendid
buildings in Germany. It is characteristic of the extravagance
of the king&rsquo;s ideas that he adopted as his model the style of
Louis XIV. and fell into the habit of imitating the <i>Roi Soleil</i>.
He no longer stayed for any length of time in one castle. Often
he scoured the country in wild nocturnal rides, and madness gained
upon him apace. His mania for buying things and making
presents was comparatively harmless, but more serious matters
were the wild extravagance which in 1880 involved him in
financial ruin, his fits of destructive rage, and the tendency
to the most cruel forms of abnormal vice. None the less, at
the time when the king&rsquo;s mental weakness was increasing, his
character still retained lovable traits&mdash;his simple sense of beauty,
his kindliness, and his highly developed understanding of art
and artistic crafts. Louis&rsquo;s love of beauty also brought material
profit to Bavaria.</p>

<p>But the financial and political dangers which arose from the
king&rsquo;s way of life were so great that interference became
necessary. On the 8th of June 1886 medical opinion declared
him to be affected with chronic and incurable madness and he
was pronounced incapable of governing. On the 10th of June
his uncle, Prince Luitpold, assumed the regency, and after
violent resistance the late king was placed under the charge
of a mental specialist. On the 13th of June 1886 he met with
his death by drowning in the Starnberger See, together with
his doctor von Gudden, who had unwisely gone for a walk
alone with his patient, whose physical strength was enormous.
The details of his death will never be fully known, as the only
possible eye-witness died with him. An examination of the brain
revealed a condition of incurable insanity, and the faculty
submitted a report giving the terrible details of his malady.
Louis&rsquo;s brother Otto, who succeeded him as king of Bavaria,
was also incurably insane.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS III.<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 863-882), king of France, was a son of Louis
II. and with his brother Carloman succeeded his father as king
in April 879. A strong party, however, cast some doubts upon
the legitimacy of the young princes, as the marriage of their
parents had not been recognized by the emperor Charles the
Bald; consequently it was proposed to offer the crown to the
East Frankish ruler Louis, a son of Louis the German. But this
plan came to nothing, and in September 879 the brothers were
crowned at Ferrières by Ansègisus, archbishop of Sens. A few
months later they divided their kingdom, Louis receiving the
part of France north of the Loire. They acted together against
the Northmen, over whom in August 881 they gained a memorable
victory. They also turned against Boso who had been set up
as king in Burgundy and Provence. On the 5th of August
882 Louis died at St Denis. He left no sons and Carloman became
sole king.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS IV.<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (921-954), king of France, surnamed &ldquo;d&rsquo;Outremer&rdquo;
(<i>Transmarinus</i>), was the son of Charles III. the Simple. In
consequence of the imprisonment of his father in 922, his mother
Odgiva (Eadgyfu), sister of the English king Æthelstan, fled
to England with the young Louis&mdash;a circumstance to which
he owes his surname. On the death of the usurper Rudolph
(Raoul), Ralph of Burgundy, Hugh the Great, count of Paris,
and the other nobles between whom France was divided, chose
Louis for their king, and the lad was brought over from England
and consecrated at Laon on the 19th of June 936. Although
his <i>de facto</i> sovereignty was confined to the town of Laon and
to some places in the north of France, Louis displayed a zeal
beyond his years in procuring the recognition of his authority
by his turbulent vassals. The beginning of his reign was marked
by a disastrous irruption of the Hungarians into Burgundy
and Aquitaine (937). In 939 Louis became involved in a struggle
with the emperor Otto the Great on the question of Lorraine,
the nobles of which district had sworn an oath of fidelity to the
king of France. When Louis married Gerberga, sister of Otto,
and widow of Giselbert, duke of Lorraine, there seemed to be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
fair prospect of peace; but the war was resumed, Otto supporting
the rebel lords of the kingdom of France, and peace was not
declared until 942, at the treaty of Visé-sur-Meuse. On the death
of William Longsword, duke of Normandy, who had been
assassinated by Arnulf, count of Flanders, in December 942,
Louis endeavoured to obtain possession of the person of Richard,
the young son and heir of the late duke. After an unsuccessful
expedition into Normandy, Louis fell into the hands of his
adversaries, and was for some time kept prisoner at Rouen
(945), and subsequently handed over to Hugh the Great, who
only consented to release him on condition that he should
surrender Laon. Menaced, however, by Louis&rsquo; brother-in-law,
Otto the Great, and excommunicated by the council of Ingelheim
(948), the powerful vassal was forced to make submission and
to restore Laon to his sovereign. The last years of the reign
were troubled by fresh difficulties with Hugh the Great and
also by an irruption of the Hungarians into the south of France.
Louis died on the 10th of September 954, and was succeeded by
his son Lothair.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS V.<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (967-987), king of France, succeeded his father
Lothair in March 986 at the age of nineteen, and finally embroiled
the Carolingian dynasty with Hugh Capet and Adalberon,
archbishop of Reims. From the absence of any important event
in his one year&rsquo;s reign the medieval chroniclers designated him
by the words &ldquo;qui nihil fecit,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;le Fainéant&rdquo; or &ldquo;do-nothing.&rdquo;
Louis died in May 987, his mother Emma being
accused of having poisoned him. He had married Adelaide,
sister of Geoffrey Grisegonelle, count of Anjou, but had no issue.
His heir by blood was Charles, duke of Lower Lorraine, son of
Louis IV., but the defection of the bishops and the treason of
Adalberon (Ascelinus), bishop of Laon, assured the success of
Hugh Capet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS VI.<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1081-1137), king of France, surnamed &ldquo;the Fat,&rdquo;
was the son of Philip I. of France and Bertha of Holland. He
was also surnamed the &ldquo;Wide-awake&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Bruiser,&rdquo;
and lost none of his energy when he earned the nickname by
which he is known in history. In 1098 Louis was made a knight,
and about the same time was associated with his father in the
government, which the growing infirmities of Philip left more and
more to his son, in spite of the opposition of Bertrada, the queen,
whose criminal union with Philip had brought the anathema of
the church. From 1100 to 1108 Louis by his victorious wars on
the English and brigands had secured the army on his side,
while the court supported Bertrada. Unable to make headway
against him in war she attempted to poison him, and contemporary
chroniclers attributed to this poison the pallor of his face,
which seems to have been in remarkable contrast to his stalwart,
and later his corpulent figure. Louis&rsquo; reign is one of the most
important in the history of France. He is little less than the
second founder of the Capetian dynasty. When the feeble and
incompetent Philip I. died (29th of July 1108) Louis was faced
by feudal barons as powerful as himself, and ready to rise against
him. He was forced to have himself hurriedly crowned at Orleans,
supported by a handful of vassals and some ecclesiastics. As
king he continued the policy he had followed during the previous
eight years, of securing the roads leading to Paris by putting down
feudal brigands and destroying their strongholds in the Île-de-France.
The castle of the most notorious of these, Hugues du
Puiset, was three times taken and burned by the king&rsquo;s men, but
Hugues was spared to go back each time to his robber life, until
he died on a crusade. In the north, Thomas de Marle, son of
Enguerrand de Coucy, carried on a career of rapine and murder
for almost thirty years before the king succeeded in taking
him prisoner (1130). Twenty-four years of continuous war
finally rooted out the robber barons who lived on the plunder of
the roads leading to Paris: the lords of Montlhéri, who commanded
the roads to Orleans, Melun and the south, those of
Montmorency near St Denis on the north (who had to restore
what they had robbed the abbey of St Denis), those of Le Puiset
toward the west, on the way to Chartres, and many others.
Parallel with this consolidation of his power in the ancestral
domains Louis met energetically the Anglo-Norman danger,
warring with Henry I. of England for twenty-five years. After
the victory of Tinchebray (1106) Louis supported the claims
of William Clito, son of Robert, duke of Normandy, against
Henry I. A ruthless war followed, in which Louis was at times
reduced to the sorest straits. In 1119, at a council held at Reims
under the presidency of Pope Calixtus II., the enemies were
reconciled; but William Clito&rsquo;s claims were not satisfied, and
in 1123 war began again on a larger scale. Henry I. induced the
emperor Henry V. to join in the attack upon France; and, his
heir having been drowned in the loss of the &ldquo;White Ship,&rdquo;
won the count of Anjou by marrying his only daughter Matilda
to Geoffrey, the Angevin heir (1127). The invasion of Henry V.
was met by something like a national army, which gathered under
Louis at Reims. &ldquo;For a few days at least, the lord of the Île-de-France
was truly a king of France&rdquo; (Luchaire). Suger
proudly gives the list of barons who appeared. Henry V. came
no farther than Metz. Royalty had won great prestige. Even
Theobald, count of Chartres, the king&rsquo;s greatest enemy,
the soul of feudal coalitions, came with his contingent. Shortly
afterwards (1126), Louis was able to overawe the great count
of Aquitaine, William IX., and force his vassal, the count of
Auvergne, to treat justly the bishop of Clermont. In Flanders
Louis interfered upon the assassination of Charles the Good.
He caused the barons to elect as their count in Arras the same
William Clito who claimed Normandy, and who was closely
bound to the king. For a while Louis had Flanders absolutely
at his disposal, but he had hardly left William alone (1127)
when his brutal oppression roused both towns and nobles, who
declared that Louis had no right to interfere in Flanders. The
death of William Clito, and a savage war with his own seneschal,
prevented Louis from effectually resenting this attitude; but
Thierry of Alsace, the new count, consented in 1128 to receive
from Louis the investiture of all his French fiefs, and henceforth
lived on good terms with him. In all his wars&mdash;those mentioned
are but a part of them&mdash;Louis fought in person. Proud of his
strength, reckless in the charge as on the march, plunging into
swollen rivers, entering blazing castles, he gained the reputation
of a national hero, the protector of the poor, the church, the
peasants and the towns. The communal movement grew during
his reign, and he encouraged it on the fiefs of his vassals in order
to weaken them; but the title &ldquo;Father of the Communes&rdquo; by
which he was known in history is not deserved, though he did
grant some privileges to towns on his domains. Neither was
Louis the author of the movement for the emancipation of the
serfs, as was formerly claimed. His attitude toward the movement
was like that of his predecessors and contemporaries,
to favour emancipation when it promised greater chance of
profit, greater scope for exploitation of the peasants; otherwise
to oppose it. He was a great benefactor to the church, aided the
new, reformed monastic congregations of Cîteau, Prémontré
and Fontevrault, and chose his two chief ministers from the
clergy. Étienne de Garlande, whom Louis raised from obscurity
to be archdeacon of Notre Dame at Paris, chancellor and seneschal
of France, was all-powerful with the king from 1108 to 1127.
His relatives monopolized the highest offices of the state. But the
queen Adelaide became his enemy; both Ivo of Chartres and
St Bernard bitterly attacked him; and the king suddenly
stripped him of all his offices and honours. Joining the rebellious
barons, Étienne then led a bitter war against the king
for three years. When Louis had reduced him to terms he
pardoned him and restored him to the chancellorship (1132),
but not to his old power. Suger (<i>q.v.</i>), administrator of St
Denis, enters the scene toward the close of this reign, but his
great work belongs to the next. Louis VI. died on the 1st of
August 1137, just a few days after his son, Louis the Young,
had set out for the far south-west, the Aquitaine which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
won by the marriage with Eleanor. His wife was Adelaide,
or Alice, daughter of Humbert II., count of Savoy, by whom
he had seven sons and a daughter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS VII.<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (<i>c</i>. 1121-1180), king of France, son of Louis VI.
the Fat, was associated with his father and anointed by Innocent
II. in 1131. In 1137 he succeeded his father, and in the same
year married at Bordeaux Eleanor, heiress of William II., duke
of Aquitaine. In the first part of his reign he was vigorous and
jealous of his prerogatives, but after his crusade his religiosity
developed to such an extent as to make him utterly inefficient.
His accession was marked by no disturbances, save the risings of
the burgesses of Orleans and of Poitiers, who wished to organize
communes. But soon he came into violent conflict with Pope
Innocent II. The archbishopric of Bourges became vacant,
and the king supported as candidate the chancellor Cadurc,
against the pope&rsquo;s nominee Pierre de la Châtre, swearing upon
relics that so long as he lived Pierre should never enter Bourges.
This brought the interdict upon the king&rsquo;s lands. At the same
time he became involved in a war with Theobald, count of
Champagne, by permitting Rodolphe (Raoul), count of Vermandois
and seneschal of France, to repudiate his wife, Theobald&rsquo;s
niece, and to marry Petronille of Aquitaine, sister of the queen
of France. The war, which lasted two years (1142-44), was
marked by the occupation of Champagne by the royal army
and the capture of Vitry, where many persons perished in the
burning of the church. Geoffrey the Handsome, count of Anjou,
by his conquest of Normandy threatened the royal domains,
and Louis VII. by a clever man&oelig;uvre threw his army on the
Norman frontier and gained Gisors, one of the keys of Normandy.
At his court which met in Bourges Louis declared on Christmas
Day 1145 his intention of going on a crusade. St Bernard assured
its popularity by his preaching at Vézelay (Easter 1146), and
Louis set out from Metz in June 1147, on the overland route
to Syria. The expedition was disastrous, and he regained
France in 1149, overcome by the humiliation of the crusade.
In the rest of his reign he showed much feebleness and poor
judgment. He committed a grave political blunder in causing
a council at Beaugency (on the 21st of March 1152) to annul his
marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, under pretext of kinship,
but really owing to violent quarrels during the crusade. Eleanor
married Henry II. of England in the following May, and brought
him the duchy of Aquitaine. Louis VII. led a half-hearted war
against Henry for having married without the authorization of
his suzerain; but in August 1154 gave up his rights over
Aquitaine, and contented himself with an indemnity. In 1154
Louis married Constance, daughter of the king of Castile, and
their daughter Marguerite he affianced imprudently by the treaty
of Gisors (1158) to Henry, eldest son of the king of England,
promising as dowry the Vexin and Gisors. Five weeks after the
death of Constance, on the 4th of October 1160, Louis VII.
married Adèle of Champagne, and Henry II. to counterbalance
the aid this would give the king of France, had the marriage of
their infant children celebrated at once. Louis VII. gave little
sign of understanding the danger of the growing Angevin power,
though in 1159 he made an expedition in the south to aid
Raymond V., count of Toulouse, who had been attacked by
Henry II. At the same time the emperor Frederick I. in the east
was making good the imperial claims on Arles. When the schism
broke out, Louis took the part of the pope Alexander III.,
the enemy of Frederick, and after two comedy-like failures of
Frederick to meet Louis VII. at Saint Jean de Losne (on the 29th
of August and the 22nd of September 1162), Louis definitely
gave himself up to the cause of Alexander, who lived at Sens
from 1163 to 1165. Alexander gave the king, in return for his
loyal support, the golden rose. Louis VII. received Thomas
Becket and tried to reconcile him with King Henry II. He
supported Henry&rsquo;s rebellious sons, but acted slowly and feebly,
and so contributed largely to the break up of the coalition
(1173-1174). Finally in 1177 the pope intervened to bring the
two kings to terms at Vitry. By his third wife, Adèle, Louis had
an heir, the future Philip Augustus, born on the 21st of August
1165. He had him crowned at Reims in 1179, but, already
stricken with paralysis, he himself was not able to be present
at the ceremony, and died on the 18th of September 1180. His
reign from the point of view of royal territory and military
power, was a period of retrogression. Yet the royal authority
had made progress in the parts of France distant from the royal
domains. More direct and more frequent connexion was made
with distant feudatories, a result largely due to the alliance of
the clergy with the crown. Louis thus reaped the reward for
services rendered the church during the least successful portion
of his reign.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS VIII.<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1187-1226), king of France, eldest son of Philip
Augustus and of Isabella of Hainaut, was born in Paris on the
5th of September 1187. Louis was short, thin, pale-faced,
with studious tastes, cold and placid temper, sober and chaste
in his life. He left the reputation of a saint, but was also a
warrior prince. In 1213 he led the campaign against Ferrand,
count of Flanders; in 1214, while Philip Augustus was winning
the victory of Bouvines, he held John of England in check, and
was victorious at La Roche-aux-Moines. In the autumn of 1215
Louis received from a group of English barons, headed by Geoffrey
de Mandeville, a request to &ldquo;pluck them out of the hand of this
tyrant&rdquo; (John). Some 7000 French knights were sent over to
England during the winter and two more contingents followed,
but it was only after twenty-four English hostages had arrived
in Paris that Louis himself prepared to invade England. The
expedition was forbidden by the papal legate, but Louis set out
from Calais on the 20th and landed at Stonor on the 22nd of
May 1216. In three months he had obtained a strong foothold
in eastern England, and in the end of July he laid siege to Dover,
while part of his army besieged Windsor with a view to securing
the safety of London. The pretexts on which he claimed the
English crown were set down in a memorandum drawn up by
French lawyers in 1215. These claims&mdash;that John had forfeited
the crown by the murder of his nephew, Arthur of Brittany,
and that the English barons had the right to dispose of the vacant
throne&mdash;lost their plausibility on the death of King John and the
accession of his infant son as Henry III. in October 1216. The
papal legate, Gualo, who had forbidden the enterprise, had
arrived in England at the same time as Louis. He excommunicated
the French troops and the English rebels, and Henry
III. found a valiant defender in William Marshal, earl of
Pembroke. After the &ldquo;Fair of Lincoln,&rdquo; in which his army
was defeated, Louis was compelled to resign his pretensions,
though by a secret article of the treaty of Lambeth (September
1217) he secured a small war indemnity. Louis had assisted
Simon de Montfort in his war against the Albigenses in 1215,
and after his return to France he again joined the crusade.
With Simon&rsquo;s son and successor, Amauri de Montfort, he directed
the brutal massacre which followed the capture of Marmande.
Philip II., suspicious of his son until the close of his life, took
precautions to assure his obedience, narrowly watched his
administration in Artois, which Louis held from his mother
Isabella, and, contrary to the custom of the kings of France,
did not associate his son with him by having him crowned.
Philip Augustus dying on the 14th of July 1223, Louis VIII.
was anointed at Reims on the 6th of August following. He
surrounded himself with councillors whom his father had chosen
and formed, and continued his father&rsquo;s policy. His reign was
taken up with two great designs: to destroy the power of the
Plantagenets, and to conquer the heretical south of France. An
expedition conquered Poitou and Saintonge (1224); in 1226 he
led the crusade against the Albigenses in the south, forced
Avignon to capitulate and received the submission of Languedoc.
While passing the Auvergne on his return to Paris, he was
stricken with dysentery, and died at Montpensier on the 8th of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
November 1226. His reign, short as it was, brought gains both
to the royal domains and to the power of the crown over the
feudal lords. He had married in 1200 Blanche of Castile,
daughter of Alphonso IX. of Castile and granddaughter of
Henry II. of England, who bore him twelve children; his
eldest surviving son was his successor, Louis IX.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS IX.<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (1214-1270), king of France, known as Saint Louis,
was born on the 25th of April 1214, and was baptized at Poissy.
His father, Louis VIII., died in 1226, leaving the first minority
since the accession of the Capetians, but his mother, Queen
Blanche of Castile, proved more than a match for the feudal
nobility. She secured her son&rsquo;s coronation at Reims on the
29th of November 1226; and, mainly by the aid of the papal
legate, Romano Bonaventura, bishop of Porto (d. 1243), and of
Thibaut IV., count of Champagne, was able to thwart the
rebellious plans of Pierre Mauclerc, duke of Brittany, and
Philippe Hurepel, a natural son of Philip Augustus. Mauclerc&rsquo;s
opposition was not finally overcome, however, until 1234.
Then in 1236 Thibaut, who had become king of Navarre, turned
against the queen, formed an alliance with Brittany, marrying
his daughter without royal consent to Jean le Roux, Mauclerc&rsquo;s
son, and attempted to make a new feudal league. The final
triumph of the regent was shown when the king&rsquo;s army assembled
at Vincennes. His summons met with such general and prompt
obedience as to awe Thibaut into submission without striking
a blow. Thus the reign of Louis IX. began with royal prerogatives
fully maintained; the kingdom was well under control, and
Mauclerc and Thibaut were both obliged to go on crusade.
But the influence of the strong-willed queen-mother continued
to make itself felt to the close of her life. Louis IX. did not
lack independence of character, but his confidence in his mother
had been amply justified and he always acted in her presence
like a child. This confidence he withheld from his wife, Margaret,
daughter of Raymond Berenger, count of Provence, whom he
married at Sens in May 1234. The reign was comparatively
uneventful. A rising of the nobles of the south-west, stirred
up by Isabella, widow of King John of England, and her husband,
Hugh de Lusignan, count of the Marche, upon the occasion of
the investment of Alphonse of Poitiers with the fiefs left him
by Louis VIII. as a result of the Albigensian crusade, reached
threatening dimensions in 1242, but the king&rsquo;s armies easily
overran Count Hugh&rsquo;s territories, and defeated Henry III. of
England, who had come to his aid, at Saintes. Isabella and
her husband were forced to submit, and Raymond VII., count
of Toulouse, yielded without resistance upon the advent of two
royal armies, and accepted the peace of Lorris in January 1243.
This was the last rising of the nobles in Louis&rsquo;s reign.</p>

<p>At the end of 1244, during an illness, Louis took the cross.
He had already been much distressed by the plight of John of
Brienne, emperor at Constantinople, and bought from him the
crown of thorns, parts of the true cross, the holy lance, and the
holy sponge. The Sainte Chapelle in Paris still stands as a
monument to the value of these relics to the saintly king. But
the quarrel between the papacy and the emperor Frederick II.,
in which Louis maintained a watchful neutrality&mdash;only interfering
to prevent the capture of Innocent IV. at Lyons&mdash;and the
difficulties of preparation, delayed the embarkation until August
1248. His defeat and capture at Mansura, in February 1250,
the next four years spent in Syria in captivity, in diplomatic
intrigues, and finally in raising the fortifications of Caesarea
and Joppa,&mdash;these events belong to the history of the crusades
(<i>q.v.</i>). His return to France was urgently needed, as Blanche
of Castile, whom he had left as regent, had died in November
1252, and upon the removal of her strong hand feudal turbulence
had begun to show itself.</p>

<p>This period between his first and second crusades (1254-1269)
is the real age of Saint Louis in the history of France. He imposed
peace between warring factions of his nobility by mere moral
force, backed up by something like an awakened public
opinion. His nobles often chafed under his unrelenting justice
but never dared rebel. The most famous of his settlements
was the treaty of Paris, drawn up in May 1258 and ratified in
December 1259, by which the claims of Henry III. of England
were adjusted. Henry renounced absolutely Normandy, Anjou,
Touraine, Maine and Poitou, and received, on condition of
recognizing Louis as liege suzerain, all the fiefs and domains
of the king of France in the dioceses of Limoges, Cahors and
Perigueux, and the expectation of Saintonge south of the
Charente, and Agenais, if they should fall to the crown of France
by the death of Alphonse of Poitiers. In addition, Louis
promised to provide Henry with sufficient money to maintain
500 knights for two years. This treaty was very unpopular
in France, since the king surrendered a large part of France
that Henry had not won; but Louis was satisfied that the
absolute sovereignty over the northern provinces more than
equalled the loss in the south. Historians still disagree as to
its wisdom. Louis made a similar compromise with the king
of Aragon in the treaty of Corbeil, 1258, whereby he gave up
the claims of kings of France to Roussillon and Barcelona, which
went back to the conquest of Charlemagne. The king of Aragon
in his turn gave up his claims to part of Provence and Languedoc,
with the exception of Narbonne. Louis&rsquo;s position was strikingly
shown in 1264 when the English barons submitted their attempt
to bind Henry III. by the Provisions of Oxford to his arbitration.
His reply in the &ldquo;Dit&rdquo; or Mise of Amiens was a flat denial of
all the claims of the barons and failed to avert the civil war.
Louis was more successful in preventing feuds between his own
nobles: between the counts of Brittany and Champagne over
the succession to Navarre; the dauphin of Vienne (Guigues
VII.) and Charles of Anjou; the count of Burgundy and the
count of Châlons; Henry of Luxemburg and the duke of Lorraine
with the count of Bar. Upon the whole he maintained peace
with his neighbours, although both Germany and England were
torn with civil wars. He reluctantly consented to sanction the
conquest of Naples by his brother, Charles, duke of Anjou, and
it is possible that he yielded here in the belief that it was a step
toward another crusade.</p>

<p>On the 24th of March 1267, Louis called to Paris such of his
knights as were not with Charles of Anjou in Naples. No one
knew why he had called them; but when the king in full assembly
proclaimed his purpose of going on a second crusade, few ventured
to refuse the cross. Three years of preparation followed; then
on the 1st of July 1270 they sailed from Aigues Mortes for Tunis,
whither the expedition seems to have been directed by the
machinations of Charles of Anjou, who, it is claimed, persuaded
his brother that the key to Egypt and to Jerusalem was that
part of Africa which was his own most dangerous neighbour.
After seventeen days&rsquo; voyage to Carthage, one month of the
summer&rsquo;s heat and plague decimated the army, and when
Charles of Anjou arrived he found that Louis himself had died
of the plague on the 25th of August 1270.</p>

<p>Saint Louis stands in history as the ideal king of the middle
ages. An accomplished knight, physically strong in spite of
his ascetic practices, fearless in battle, heroic in adversity, of
imperious temperament, unyielding when sure of the justness
of his cause, energetic and firm, he was indeed &ldquo;every inch a king.&rdquo;
Joinville says that he was taller by a head than any of his knights.
His devotions would have worn out a less robust saint. He
fasted much, loved sermons, regularly heard two masses a day
and all the offices, dressing at midnight for matins in his chapel,
and surrounded even when he travelled by priests on horseback
chanting the hours. After his return from the first crusade,
he wore only grey woollens in winter, dark silks in summer.
He built hospitals, visited and tended the sick himself, gave
charity to over a hundred beggars daily. Yet he safeguarded
the royal dignity by bringing them in at the back door of the
palace, and by a courtly display greater than ever before in
France. His naturally cold temperament was somewhat
relieved by a sense of humour, which however did not prevent
his making presents of haircloth shirts to his friends. He had no
favourite, nor prime minister. Louis was canonized in 1297.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span></p>

<p>As a statesman Louis IX. has left no distinct monument.
The famous &ldquo;<i>Établissements</i> of St Louis&rdquo; has been shown
in our own day to have been private compilation. It was a
<i>coutumier</i> drawn up before 1273, including, as well as some royal
decrees, the civil and feudal law of Anjou, Maine and the
Orléanais. Recent researches have also denied Louis the credit
of having aided the communes. He exploited them to the full.
His standpoint in this respect was distinctly feudal. He treated
his clergy as he did his barons, enforcing the supremacy of
royal justice, and strongly opposing the exactions of the pope
until the latter part of his reign, when he joined forces with him
to extort as much as possible from the clergy. At the end of
the reign most of the sees and monasteries of France were in
debt to the Lombard bankers. Finally, the reign of Saint
Louis saw the introduction of the pontifical inquisition into
France.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are numerous portraits of St Louis, but they are unauthentic
and contradictory. In 1903 M. Salomon Reinach claimed to have
found in the heads sculptured in the angles of the arches of the chapel
at St Germain portraits of St Louis, his brothers and sisters, and
Queen Marguerite, or Blanche, made between 1235 and 1240. This
conjectured portrait somewhat resembles the modern type, which
is based upon a statue of Charles V. once in the church of the Celestins
in Paris, and which Lenoir mistakenly identified as that of Louis IX.
The king had eleven children, six sons and five daughters, among
them being his successor, Philip III., and Robert, count of Clermont,
the ancestor of Henry IV.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS X.<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> (1289-1316), king of France and Navarre, called
<i>le Hutin</i> or &ldquo;the Quarreller,&rdquo; was the son of Philip IV. and
of Jeanne of Navarre. He was born at Paris on the 4th of
October 1289, took the title king of Navarre on the death of
his mother, on the 2nd of April 1305, and succeeded Philip IV.
in France on the 29th of November 1314, being crowned at
Reims in August 1315. The origin of his surname is uncertain.
Louis X. is a somewhat indistinct figure among the kings of
France, the preponderating influence at court during his short
reign being that of his uncle, Charles of Valois. The reign
began with reaction against the policy of Philip IV. Private
vengeance was wreaked on Enguerrand de Marigny, who was
hanged, Pierre de Latilli, bishop of Châlons and chancellor,
and Raoul de Presle, advocate of the parlement, who were
imprisoned. The leagues of the lesser country gentry, formed
in 1314 before the accession of Louis, continued to demand
the ancient privileges of the nobility,&mdash;tourneys, private wars
and judgment of nobles not by king&rsquo;s officers but by their peers&mdash;and
to protest against the direct call by the king of their vassals
to the royal army. Louis X. granted them charters in which
he made apparent concessions, but used evasive formulas which
in reality ceded nothing. There was a charter to the Normans,
one to the Burgundians, one to the Languedocians (1315).
Robert de Béthune, count of Flanders, refused to do homage,
and his French fiefs were declared confiscate by a court of his
peers. In August 1315 Louis X. led an army toward Lille,
but the flooded Lys barred his passage, the ground was so soaked
with rains that the army could not advance, and it was thrown
back, without a battle, on Tournai. Need of money inspired
one famous ordinance of this reign; in 1315 the serfs of the
royal domains were invited to buy their civil liberty,&mdash;an invitation
which did not meet with great enthusiasm, as the
freedman was merely freed for further exploitation, and Philip V.
was obliged to renew it in 1318. Louis X. died suddenly on
the 5th of June 1316. His first wife was Margaret, daughter
of Robert II., duke of Burgundy; she was accused of adultery
and died a prisoner in the château Gaillard. By her he had one
daughter, Jeanne, wife of Philip, count of Evreux and king
of Navarre. By his second wife Clémence, daughter of Charles
Martel, titular king of Hungary, he left a posthumous son,
King John I.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS XI.<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (1423-1483), king of France, the son of Charles
VII. and his queen, Marie of Anjou, was born on the 3rd of July
1423, at Bourges, where his father, then nicknamed the &ldquo;King
of Bourges,&rdquo; had taken refuge from the English. At the birth
of Louis XI. part of France was in English hands; when he
was five years old, Joan of Arc appeared; he was just six when
his father was crowned at Reims. But his boyhood was spent
apart from these stirring events, in the castle of Loches, where
his father visited him rarely. John Gerson, the foremost theologian
of France, wrote a manual of instructions (still extant)
for the first of his tutors, Jean Majoris, a canon of Reims. His
second tutor, Bernard of Armagnac, was noted for his piety
and humility. If, as has been claimed, Louis owed to them
any of his tendency to prefer the society of the poor, or rather
of the <i>bourgeois</i>, to that of the nobility, their example was his
best lesson in the craft of kingship. In June 1436, when scarcely
thirteen, he was married to Margaret (<i>c</i>. 1425-1445), daughter
of James I. of Scotland, a princess of about his own age, but
sickly and romantic, and in every way his opposite. Three
years after this unhappy marriage Louis entered upon his stormy
political career. Sent by his father in 1439 to direct the defence
of Languedoc against the English, and to put down the brigandage
in Poitou, he was induced by the rebellious nobles to betray
his trust and place himself at the head of the Praguerie (<i>q.v.</i>).
Charles VII. pardoned him this rebellion, due to his ambition
and the seductive proposal of the nobles to make him regent.
The following year he was fighting the English, and in 1443
aided his father to suppress the revolt of the count of Armagnac.
His first important command, however, was in the next year,
when he led an army of from 15,000 to 20,000 mercenaries and
brigands,&mdash;the product of the Hundred Years&rsquo; War,&mdash;against
the Swiss of the canton of Basel. The heroism of some two
hundred Swiss, who for a while held thousands of the French
army at bay, made a great impression on the young prince.
After an ineffective siege of Basel, he made peace with the
Swiss confederation, and led his robber soldiers into Alsace to
ravage the country of the Habsburgs, who refused him the
promised winter quarters. Meanwhile his father, making a
parallel campaign in Lorraine, had assembled his first brilliant
court at Nancy, and when Louis returned it was to find the
king completely under the spell of Agnes Sorel. He at first
made overtures to members of her party, and upon their rejection
through fear of his ambition, his deadly hatred of her and
of them involved the king. The death in 1445 of his wife
Margaret, who was a great favourite of Charles VII., made the
rupture complete. From that year until the death of the king
father and son were enemies. Louis began his rebellious career
by a futile attempt to seduce the cities of Agenais into treason,
and then he prepared a plot to seize the king and his minister
Pierre de Brézé. Antoine de Chabannes, who was to be the
instrument of the plot, revealed it to Charles, and Louis was
mildly punished by being sent off to Dauphiné (1447). He
never saw his father again.</p>

<p>Louis set out to govern his principality as though it were
an independent state. He dismissed the governor; he determined
advantageously to himself the boundaries between his state
and the territories of the duke of Savoy and of the papacy;
and he enforced his authority over perhaps the most unruly
nobility in western Europe, both lay and ecclesiastical. The
right of private warfare was abolished; the bishops were obliged
to give up most of their temporal jurisdiction, the scope of their
courts was limited, and appeals to Rome were curtailed. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
the other hand, Louis granted privileges to the towns and consistently
used their alliance to overthrow the nobility. He
watched the roads, built new ones, opened markets, protected
the only bankers of the country, the Jews, and reorganized the
administration so as to draw the utmost revenue possible from
the prosperity thus secured. His ambition led him into foreign
entanglements; he made a secret treaty with the duke of Savoy
which was to give him right of way to Genoa, and made arrangements
for a partition of the duchy of Milan. The alliance with
Savoy was sealed by the marriage of Louis with Charlotte,
daughter of Duke Lodovico, in 1452, in spite of the formal
prohibition of Charles VII. The king marched south, but
withdrew again leaving his son unsubdued. Four years later,
as Charles came to the Bourbonnais, Louis, fearing for his life,
fled to Flanders to the court of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy,
leaving Dauphiné to be definitely annexed to the crown
of France. The policy of the dauphin was reversed, his ten
years&rsquo; work was undone. Meanwhile he was installed in the
castle of Genappe, in Brabant, where he remained until the death
of his father. For this he waited impatiently five years, keeping
himself posted by spies of every stage of the king&rsquo;s last illness,
and thus laying himself open to the accusation, believed in
by Charles himself, that he had hastened the end by poison, a
charge which modern historians deny.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August 1461, Louis was anointed at Reims,
and Philip of Burgundy, as <i>doyen</i> of the peers of France, placed
the crown on his head. For two months Philip acted as though
the king were still his protégé. But in the midst of the festivities
with which he was entertaining Paris, the duke found that Louis
ventured to refuse his candidates for office, and on the 24th of
September the new king left abruptly for Touraine. His first
act was to strike at the faithful ministers of Charles VII. Pierre
de Brézé and Antoine de Chabannes were captured and imprisoned,
as well as men of sterling worth like Étienne Chevalier.
But the king&rsquo;s shrewdness triumphed before long over his vengeance,
and the more serviceable of the officers of Charles VII.
were for the most part soon reinstated, Louis&rsquo; advisers were
mostly men of the middle class. He had a ready purse for
men of talent, drawing them from England, Scotland, Italy,
Spain and Portugal. Such a motley throng of competent men
had never before been seen at the court of France. Their origin,
their previous crimes or virtues, their avarice or brutality,
were indifferent to him so long as they served him loyally.
Torture and imprisonment awaited them, whether of high or
low degree, if he fancied that they were betraying him. Among
the most prominent of these men in addition to Brézé, Chevalier
and Chabannes, were Tristan Lermite, Jean de Daillon, Olivier
le Dain (the barber), and after 1472, Philippe de Commines,
drawn from the service of Charles the Bold of Burgundy, who
became his most intimate adviser and biographer. Surrounded
by men like these Louis fought the last great battle of French
royalty with feudalism.</p>

<p>Louis XI. began his reign with the same high-handed treatment
of the nobles which had marked his rule in Dauphiné,
going so far as to forbid them to hunt without his permission. He
forced the clergy to pay long-neglected feudal dues, and intrigued
against the great houses of Anjou and Orleans in Italy. The malcontent
nobles soon began to plan revolt. Discharged officers of
Charles VII. like Jean Dunois and John II. duke of Bourbon,
stirred up hostility to the new men of the king, and Francis II.
duke of Brittany was soon embroiled with Louis over an attempt
to assert royal control over that practically independent duchy.
The dissatisfied nobility found their greatest ally in Charles the
Bold, afterwards duke of Burgundy, and in 1465 formed a
&ldquo;league of public welfare&rdquo; and declared war on their king.
The nominal head was the king&rsquo;s brother Charles, duke of Berry,
then eighteen years old, a weak character, the tool of the rebels
as he was later the dupe of the king. Every great noble in
France was in the league, except Gaston de Foix&mdash;who kept the
south of France for the king,&mdash;and the counts of Vendôme and
Eu. The whole country seemed on the verge of anarchy. It
was saved by the refusal of the lesser gentry to rise, and by the
alliance of the king with the citizen class, which was not led
astray by the pretences of regard for the public weal which
cloaked the designs of the leaguers. After a successful campaign
in the Bourbonnais, Louis fought an indecisive battle with the
Burgundians who had marched on Paris at Montlhéry, on the
16th of July 1465, and then stood a short siege in Paris. On the
28th of September he made a truce with Charles the Bold, and
in October the treaties of Conflans and Saint Maur-les-Fossés,
ended the war. The king yielded at all points; gave up the
&ldquo;Somme towns&rdquo; in Picardy, for which he had paid 200,000
gold crowns, to Philip the Good, thus bringing the Burgundians
close to Paris and to Normandy. Charles, the king&rsquo;s
brother, was given Normandy as an apanage, thus joining
the territories of the rebellious duke of Brittany with those
of Charles the Bold. The public weal was no longer talked
about, while the kingdom was plundered both by royal tax
gatherers and by unsubdued feudal lords to pay the cost of
the war.</p>

<p>After this failure Louis set to work to repair his mistakes. The
duke of Bourbon was won over by the gift of the government
of the centre of France, and Dunois and Chabannes by restoring
them their estates. Two months after he had granted Normandy
to Charles, he took advantage of a quarrel between the duke of
Brittany and his brother to take it again, sending the duke
of Bourbon &ldquo;to aid&rdquo; Charles, while Dunois and Chabannes
prepared for the struggle with Burgundy. The death of Duke
Philip, on the 15th of June 1467, gave Charles the Bold a free
hand. He gained over Edward IV. of England, whose sister
Margaret he married; but while he was celebrating the wedding
Louis invaded Brittany and detached Duke Francis from
alliance with him. Normandy was completely reduced. The
king had won a great triumph. It was followed by his greatest
mistake. Eager as he always was to try diplomacy instead of
war, Louis sent a gift of 60,000 golden crowns to Charles and
secured a safe conduct from him for an interview. The interview
took place on the 9th of October 1468 at Péronne. News came on
the 11th that, instigated by the king of France, the people of
Liége had massacred their bishop and the ducal governor. The
news was false, but Charles, furious at such apparent duplicity,
took Louis prisoner, only releasing him, three days later, on the
king signing a treaty which granted Flanders freedom from
interference from the parlement of Paris, and agreeing to accompany
Charles to the siege of his own ally, Liége. Louis made
light of the whole incident in his letters, but it marked the greatest
humiliation of his life, and he was only too glad to find a scapegoat
in Cardinal Jean Balue, who was accused of having plotted the
treason of Péronne. Balue thereupon joined Guillaume de
Harancourt, bishop of Verdun, in an intrigue to induce Charles of
France to demand Champagne and Brie in accordance with the
king&rsquo;s promise to Charles the Bold, instead of distant Guienne
where the king was determined to place him. The discovery of
this conspiracy placed these two high dignitaries in prison (April
1469). Balue (<i>q.v.</i>) spent eleven years in prison quarters, comfortable
enough, in spite of the legend to the contrary, while
Harancourt was shut up in an iron cage until 1482. Then Louis,
inducing his brother to accept Guienne,&mdash;where, surrounded by
faithful royal officers, he was harmless for the time being,&mdash;undertook
to play off the Lancastrians against Edward IV. who, as
the ally of Charles the Bold, was menacing the coast of Normandy.
Warwick, the king-maker, and Queen Margaret were aided in the
expedition which in 1470 again placed Henry VI. upon the English
throne. In the autumn Louis himself took the offensive, and royal
troops overran Picardy and the Maconnais to Burgundy itself.
But the tide turned against Louis in 1471. While Edward IV.
won back England by the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury,
Charles the Bold besieged Amiens, and Louis was glad to make
a truce, availing himself of the double dealing of the constable,
the count of Saint Pol, who, trying to win an independent position
for himself in Picardy, refused his aid to Charles unless he would
definitely join the French nobility in another rising against the
king. This rising was to be aided by the invasion of France by
John II. of Aragon, Yolande, duchess of Savoy, and Edward IV.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
of England, who was to be given the old Plantagenet inheritance.
The country was saved a desperate civil war by the death of the
king&rsquo;s brother, Charles, the nominal head of the coalition, on the
24th of May 1472. Louis&rsquo; joy on receiving news of this death
knew no bounds. Charles the Bold, who had again invaded
France, failed to take Beauvais, and was obliged to make a
lasting truce. His projects were henceforth to be directed
towards Germany. Louis then forced the duke of Brittany
to make peace, and turned against John V. count of Armagnac,
whose death at the opening of March 1473 ended the power of
one of the most dangerous houses of the south. The first period
of Louis&rsquo; reign was closed, and with it closed for ever the danger
of dismemberment of France. John of Aragon continued the war
in Roussillon and Cerdagne, which Louis had seized ten years
before, and a most desperate rising of the inhabitants protracted
the struggle for two years. After the capture of Perpignan on the
10th of March 1475, the wise and temperate government of
Imbert de Batarnay and Boffile de Juge slowly pacified the new
provinces. The death of Gaston IV. count of Foix in 1472
opened up the long diplomatic struggle for Navarre, which was
destined to pass to the loyal family of Albret shortly after the
death of Louis. His policy had won the line of the Pyrenees
for France.</p>

<p>The overthrow of Charles the Bold was the second great task
of Louis XI. This he accomplished by a policy much like that
of Pitt against Napoleon. Louis was the soul of all hostile
coalitions, especially urging on the Swiss and Sigismund of
Austria, who ruled Tirol and Alsace. Charles&rsquo;s ally, Edward IV.,
invaded France in June 1475, but Louis bought him off on the
29th of August at Picquigny&mdash;where the two sovereigns met on
a bridge over the Somme, with a strong grille between them,
Edward receiving 75,000 crowns, and a promise of a pension of
50,000 crowns annually. The dauphin Charles was to marry
Edward&rsquo;s daughter. Bribery of the English ministers was not
spared, and in September the invaders recrossed to England.
The count of Saint Pol, who had continued to play his double
part, was surrendered by Charles to Louis, and executed, as was
also Jacques d&rsquo;Armagnac, duke of Nemours. With his vassals
terrorized and subdued, Louis continued to subsidize the Swiss
and René II. of Lorraine in their war upon Charles. The defeat
and death of the duke of Burgundy at Nancy on the 5th of
January 1477 was the crowning triumph of Louis&rsquo; diplomacy.
But in his eagerness to seize the whole inheritance of his rival,
Louis drove his daughter and heiress, Mary of Burgundy, into
marriage with Maximilian of Austria (afterwards the emperor
Maximilian I.), who successfully defended Flanders after a savage
raid by Antoine de Chabannes. The battle of Guinegate on the
7th of August 1479 was indecisive, and definite peace was
not established until after the death of Mary, when by the treaty
of Arras (1482) Louis received Picardy, Artois and the Boulonnais,
as well as the duchy of Burgundy and Franche Comté. The
Austrians were left in Flanders, a menace and a danger. Louis
failed here and in Spain; this failure being an indirect cause of
that vast family compact which surrounded France later with
the empire of Charles V. His interference in Spain had made
both John II. of Aragon and Henry IV. of Castile his enemies,
and so he was unable to prevent the marriage of their heirs,
Ferdinand and Isabella. But the results of these marriages
could not be foreseen, and the unification of France proved of
more value than the possession of so widespread an empire.
This unification was completed (except for Brittany) and the
frontiers enlarged by the acquisition, upon the death of René
of Anjou in 1480, of the duchies of Anjou and Bar, and in 1481
of Maine and Provence upon the death of Charles II., count of
Maine. Of the inheritance of the house of Anjou only Lorraine
escaped the king.</p>

<p>Failure in Spain was compensated for in Italy. Without
waging war Louis made himself virtual arbiter of the fate of
the principalities in the north, and his court was always besieged
by ambassadors from them. After the death of Charles the
Bold, Yolande, duchess of Savoy, was obliged to accept the
control of Louis, who was her brother. In Milan he helped to
place Lodovico il Moro in power in 1479, but he reaped less from
this supple tyrant than he had expected. Pope Sixtus IV.
the enemy of the Medici, was also the enemy of the king of
France. Louis, who at the opening of his reign had denounced
the Pragmatic Sanction of 1438, had played fast and loose with
the papacy. When Sixtus threatened Florence after the Pazzi
conspiracy, 1478, Louis aided Lorenzo dei Medici to form an
alliance with Naples, which forced the papacy to come to terms.</p>

<p>More than any other king of France, Louis XI. was a
&ldquo;bourgeois king.&rdquo; The upper bourgeois, the aristocracy of
his &ldquo;good cities,&rdquo; were his allies both against the nobles and
against the artisan class, whenever they revolted, driven to
desperation by the oppressive royal taxes which furnished the
money for his wars or diplomacy. He ruled like a modern
capitalist; placed his bribes like investments in the courts of
his enemies; and, while draining the land of enormous sums,
was pitiless toward the two productive portions of his realm,
the country population and the artisans. His heartlessness
toward the former provoked even an accomplice like Commines
to protest. The latter were kept down by numerous edicts,
tending to restrict to certain privileged families the rank of master
workman in the gilds. There was the paternalism of a Frederick
the Great in his encouragement of the silk industry,&mdash;&ldquo;which
all idle people ought to be made to work at,&rdquo;&mdash;in his encouragement
of commerce through the newly acquired port of Marseilles
and the opening up of market placed. He even dreamed of a
great trading company &ldquo;of two hundred thousand livres or
more,&rdquo; to monopolize the trade of the Mediterranean, and
planned to unify the various systems of weights and measures.
In 1479 he called a meeting of two burgesses from each &ldquo;good
city&rdquo; of his realm to consider means for preventing the influx
of foreign coin. Impatient of all restraint upon his personal rule,
he was continually in violent dispute with the parlement of
Paris, and made &ldquo;justice&rdquo; another name for arbitrary government;
yet he dreamed of a unification of the local customary
laws (<i>coûtumes</i>) of France. He was the perfect model of a tyrant.
The states-general met but once in his reign, in 1468, and then
no talk of grievances was allowed; his object was only to get
them to declare Normandy inalienable from the crown. They
were informed that the king could raise his revenue without
consulting them. Yet his budgets were enormously greater
than ever before. In 1481 the <i>taille</i> alone brought in 4,600,000
livres, and even at the peaceful close of his reign his whole
budget was 4,655,000 livres&mdash;as against 1,800,000 livres at
the close of his father&rsquo;s reign.</p>

<p>The king who did most for French royalty would have made
a sorry figure at the court of a Louis XIV. He was ungainly,
with rickety legs. His eyes were keen and piercing, but a long
hooked nose lent grotesqueness to a face marked with cunning
rather than with dignity. Its ugliness was emphasized by the
old felt hat which he wore,&mdash;its sole ornament the leaden figure
of a saint. Until the close of his life, when he tried to mislead
ambassadors as to the state of his health by gorgeous robes,
he wore the meanest clothes. Dressed in grey like a pilgrim,
and accompanied by five or six trustworthy servants, he would
set out on his interminable travels, &ldquo;ambling along on a good
mule.&rdquo; Thus he traversed France, avoiding all ceremony,
entering towns by back streets, receiving ambassadors in wayside
huts, dining in public houses, enjoying the loose manners
and language of his associates, and incidentally learning at first
hand the condition of his people and the possibilities of using
or taxing them&mdash;his needs of them rather than theirs of him.
He loved to win men, especially those of the middle class, by
affability and familiarity, employing all his arts to cajole and
seduce those whom he needed. Yet his honied words easily
turned to gall. He talked rapidly and much, sometimes for
hours at a time, and most indiscreetly. He was not an agreeable
companion, violent in his passions, nervous, restless, and in old
age extremely irascible. Utterly unscrupulous, and without a
trace of pity, he treated men like pawns, and was content only
with absolute obedience.</p>

<p>But this Machiavellian prince was the genuine son of St Louis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
His religiosity was genuine if degenerate. He lavished presents
on influential saints, built shrines, sent gifts to churches, went
on frequent pilgrimages and spent much time in prayer&mdash;employing
his consummate diplomacy to win celestial allies, and
rewarding them richly when their aid secured him any advantage.
St Martin of Tours received 1200 crowns after the capture of
Perpignan. He tried to bribe the saints of his enemies, as he
did their ministers. An unfaltering faith taught him the value
of religion&mdash;as a branch of politics. Finally, more in the spirit
of orthodoxy, he used the same arts to make sure of heaven.
When the ring of St Zanobius and the blood of Cape Verde
turtles gave him no relief from his last illness, he showered gifts
upon his patron saints, secured for his own benefit the masses
of his clergy, and the most potent prayers in Christendom, those
of the two most effective saints of his day, Bernardin of Doulins
and Francis of Paolo.</p>

<p>During the last two or three years of his life Louis lived in
great isolation, &ldquo;seeing no one, speaking with no one, except
such as he commanded,&rdquo; in the château of Plessis-les-Tours,
that &ldquo;spider&rsquo;s nest&rdquo; bristling with watch towers, and guarded
only by the most trusty servitors. A swarm of astrologers and
physicians preyed upon his fears&mdash;and his purse. But, however
foolish in his credulity, he still made his strong hand felt both in
France and in Italy, remaining to the last &ldquo;the terrible king.&rdquo;
His fervent prayers were interrupted by instructions for the
regency which was to follow. He died on the 30th of August
1483, and was buried, according to his own wish, without royal
state, in the church at Cléry, instead of at St Denis. He left
a son, his successor, Charles VIII., and two daughters.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS XII.<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (1462-1515), king of France, was grandson of
Louis of Orleans, the brother of Charles VI., and son of the
poet prince, Charles of Orleans, who, after the battle of Agincourt,
spent twenty-five years of captivity in England. Louis
was duke of Orleans until his accession to the throne, and he
was fourteen years old when Louis XI. gave him the hand of
his second daughter, Joan the Lame. In the first years of the
reign of Charles VIII., Louis made a determined stand against
the government of the Beaujeus, stirred up coalitions of the
feudal nobles against them, and was finally defeated and taken
prisoner at St Aubin du Cormier in 1488. Charles VIII. set
him at liberty in 1491. These successive checks tamed him a
little. In the Italian expedition of 1494 he commanded the
vanguard of the royal army, occupied Genoa, and remained in
the north of Italy, menacing Milan, on which he was already
dreaming of asserting his rights. The children of Charles VIII.
having died in infancy, he became heir-presumptive to the throne,
and succeeded Charles in 1499. Louis was then thirty-six years
old, but he seems to have grown old prematurely. He was
fragile, narrow-shouldered and of a sickly constitution. His
intelligence was mediocre, his character weak, and he allowed
himself to be dominated by his wife, Anne of Brittany, and
his favourite the Cardinal d&rsquo;Amboise. He was a good king,
full of moderation and humanity, and bent upon maintaining
order and improving the administration of justice. He enjoyed
a genuine popularity, and in 1506 the estates of Tours conferred
on him the surname of <i>Père du Peuple</i>. His foreign policy,
which was directed wholly towards Italy, was for the most part
unskilful; to his claims on Naples he added those on Milan,
which he based on the marriage of his grandfather, Louis of
Orleans, with Valentina Visconti. He led in person several
armies into Italy, and proved as severe and pitiless towards
his enemies as he was gentle and clement towards his subjects.
Louis had two daughters. After his accession he had divorced
his virtuous and ill-favoured queen, Joan, and had married,
in 1499, Anne of Brittany, the widow of Charles VIII. On her
death in January 1514, in order to detach England from the
alliance against him, he married on the 9th of October 1514,
Mary Tudor, sister of Henry VIII. of England (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mary</a></span>, queen
of France). He died on the 1st of January 1515.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS XIII<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span>. (1601-1643), king of France, was the son of
Henry IV. and of Marie de&rsquo; Medici. He became king on his
father&rsquo;s assassination in 1610; but his mother at once seized
the full powers of regent. She determined to reverse the policy
of her husband and to bring France into alliance with Spain
and the Austrian house, upon which power Henry had been
meditating an attack at the time of his death. Two marriages
were designed to cement this alliance. Louis was to marry
Anne of Austria, daughter of the Spanish king, Philip III.,
and the Spanish prince, afterwards Philip IV., himself was to
marry the Princess Elizabeth, the king&rsquo;s sister. Notwithstanding
the opposition of the Protestants and nobles of France,
the queen carried through her purpose and the marriages were
concluded in 1615. The next years were full of civil war and
political intrigue, during which the queen relied upon the
Marshal d&rsquo;Ancre. Louis XIII. was a backward boy, and his
education had been much neglected. We have the fullest
details of his private life, and yet his character remains something
of a mystery. He was fond of field sports and seemed
to acquiesce in his mother&rsquo;s occupation of power and in the rule
of her favourites. But throughout his life he concealed his
purposes even from his closest friends; sometimes it seems as
if he were hardly conscious of them himself. In 1617 he was
much attached to Charles d&rsquo;Albert, sieur de Luynes; and with
his help he arrested Marshal d&rsquo;Ancre, and on his resistance had
him assassinated. From this time to her death the relation
between the king and his mother was one of concealed or open
hostility. The article on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span> must be consulted for the
intricate events of the following years.</p>

<p>The decisive incident for his private life as well as for his
reign was the entrance of Cardinal Richelieu, hitherto the
queen&rsquo;s chief adviser, into the king&rsquo;s council in 1624. Henceforth
the policy of France was directed by Richelieu, who took
up in its main features the system of Protestant alliances and
opposition to the power of Austria and Spain, which had been
begun by Henry IV. and had been interrupted by the queen-mother
during the regency; while he asserted the power of the
crown against all rivals at home. This policy had remarkable
results for the king&rsquo;s private life. It not only brought him into
unremitting conflict with the Protestants and the nobles of
France, but also made him the enemy of his mother, of his brother
Gaston of Orleans, who made himself the champion of the cause
of the nobles, and sometimes even of his wife. It is not easy
to define his relations to Richelieu. He was convinced of his
loyalty and of his genius, and in the end always supported his
policy. But he disliked the friction with his family circle which
this policy produced. In the difficulty with which he expressed
himself and in a certain indecision of character the king was
curiously unlike his father, the frank and impetuous Henry
of Navarre, and his absolute son Louis XIV. He took a great
interest in all the externals of war. He was present, and is
said to have played an important part at the passage of Susa
in 1629, and also eagerly participated in the siege of Rochelle,
which surrendered in the same year. But for the most part
his share in the great events of the reign was a passive one. The
one all-important fact was that he supported his great minister.
There were certain occasions when it seemed as if that support
would be denied. The chief of these was what is known as the
&ldquo;Day of Dupes&rdquo; (1630). Then the queen-mother and the king&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
brother passionately attacked the minister, and for a moment
it was believed that Richelieu was dismissed and that the queen-mother
and a Spanish policy had triumphed. But the sequel
only strengthened the power of the minister. He regained his
ascendancy over the king, punished his enemies and forced
Marie de&rsquo; Medici and Gaston of Orleans to sue for pardon.
In 1631 Gaston fled to Lorraine and the queen-mother to
Brussels. Gaston soon returned, to plot, to fail and to sue for
pardon again and again; but Marie de&rsquo;Medici ended her life
in exile.</p>

<p>Richelieu&rsquo;s position was much strengthened by these incidents,
but to the end of life he had to struggle against conspiracies
which were designed to deprive him of the king&rsquo;s support, and
usually Gaston of Orleans had some share in these movements.
In 1632 the duke of Montmorency&rsquo;s conspiracy brought its
leader to the scaffold. But the last great effort to overthrow
Richelieu was closely connected with the king. Louis XIII.
had from the beginning of his reign had favourites&mdash;young men
for the most part with whom he lived freely and intimately
and spoke of public affairs lightly and unreservedly; and who
in consequence often exaggerated their influence over him.
Henri d&rsquo;Effiat, marquis de Cinq-Mars, was the last of these
favourites. The king is said to have allowed him to speak
hostilely of Richelieu and even to recall the assassination of
Marshal d&rsquo;Ancre. Cinq-Mars believed himself secure of the
king&rsquo;s favour. He entered into negotiations with Spain and
was secretly supported by Gaston of Orleans. But Richelieu
discovered his treasonous relations with Spain and by this
means defeated his plot. Louis was reconciled to his minister.
&ldquo;We have lived too long together to be separated&rdquo; he is
reported to have said (September 1642). Yet when Richelieu
died in December of the same year he allowed himself to speak
of him in a jealous and satirical tone. He died himself a few
months later (May 1643).</p>

<p>His nature was timid, lethargic and melancholy, and his court
was not marked by the scandals which had been seen under
Henry IV. Yet Mademoiselle de la Fayette and Madame
d&rsquo;Hautefort and others are said to have been his mistresses.
His brother Gaston survived him, but gave unexpectedly little
trouble during the wars of the Fronde which ensued on the death
of Louis XIII.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS XIV<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span>. (1638-1715), king of France, was born at Saint-Germain-en-Laye
on the 5th of September 1638. His father,
Louis XIII., had married Anne of Austria, daughter of Philip III.,
king of Spain, in 1615, but for twenty years the marriage
had remained without issue. The childlessness of the king was
a constant threat to the policy of his great minister Richelieu;
for the king&rsquo;s brother and heir, Gaston of Orleans, was a determined
opponent of that policy. The birth of the prince who
was destined to reign as Louis XIV. was therefore hailed as a
triumph, not less important than any of those won by diplomacy
or arms. The death of his father made Louis XIV. king on the
14th of May 1643, but he had to wait sixteen years before he
began to rule. Power lay for some time in the hands of the
queen-mother and in those of her minister, Cardinal Mazarin,
who found it difficult to maintain the power of the throne and
the integrity of French territory during the domestic troubles
of the Fronde and the last stages of the Thirty Year&rsquo;s War. The
minister was hated as a foreigner, and the childhood of the king
weakened the royal authority. Twice the court had to flee from
Paris; once when there was a rumour of intended flight the
populace was admitted to see the king in his bed. The memory
of these humiliations played their part in developing later the
autocratic ideas of Louis. Mazarin, in spite of all disadvantages,
triumphed alike over his domestic and his foreign opponents.
The Fronde was at an end by 1653; the peace of Westphalia
(1648) and the peace of the Pyrenees (1659) marked the success
of the arms and of the diplomacy of France. Louis XIV.
was now twenty-one years of age and was anxious to rule as
well as to reign. The peace of the Pyrenees was a decisive
event in his personal history as well as in that of France, for
one of its most important stipulations referred to his marriage.
He had already been strongly attracted to one of the nieces of
Mazarin, but reasons of state triumphed over personal impulse;
and it was agreed that the new friendship with Spain should
be cemented by the marriage of Louis to his cousin, the Infanta
Maria Theresa. A large dowry was stipulated for; and in
consideration of this the king promised to forgo all claims that
his wife might otherwise possess to the Spanish crown or any part
of its territories. The dowry was never paid, and the king held
himself free of his promise.</p>

<p>The marriage took place at once, and the king entered Paris
in triumph in 1660. Mazarin died in the next year; but so
strong was the feeling that the kings of France could only rule
through a first minister that it was generally expected that
Mazarin would soon have a successor. The king, however, at
once announced his intention of being his own first minister;
and from this resolution he never swerved. Whatever great
qualities he may have lacked he certainly possessed industry and
patience in the highest degree. He built up a thoroughly
personal system of government, and presided constantly over the
council and many of its committees. He was fond of gaiety and
of sport; but neither ever turned him away from the punctual
and laborious discharge of his royal duties. Even the greatest
of his ministers found themselves controlled by the king.
Fouquet, the finance minister, had accumulated enormous
wealth during the late disturbances, and seemed to possess power
and ambition too great for a subject. Louis XIV. found it
necessary almost to conspire against him; he was overthrown
and condemned to perpetual imprisonment. Those who had
most of the king&rsquo;s confidence afterwards were Colbert for home
affairs; Lionne for diplomacy; Louvois for war; but as his
reign proceeded he became more self-confident and more
intolerant of independence of judgment in his ministers.</p>

<p>His court was from the first one of great brilliance. In art
and in literature, the great period, which is usually called by
the king&rsquo;s name, had in some respects passed its zenith when he
began to reign. But France was unquestionably the first state
in Europe both in arms and arts, and within France the authority
of the king was practically undisputed. The nation, proud of
its pre-eminence and weary of civil war, saw in the king its true
representative and the guarantee of its unity and success. Louis
was singularly well fitted by his physical and intellectual gifts
for the rôle of <i>Grand Monarque</i> and he played it to perfection.
His wife Maria Theresa bore him children but there was no
community of tastes between them, and the chief influence at
court is to be found not in the queen but in the succession
of avowed mistresses. Mademoiselle de la Vallière held the
position from 1662 to 1670; she was then ousted by Madame de
Montespan, who had fiercely intrigued for it, and whose proud
and ambitious temper offered a great contrast to her rival. She
held her position from 1670 to 1679 and then gave place to the
still more famous Madame de Maintenon, who ruled, however,
not as mistress but as wife. The events that brought about this
incident form the strangest episode in the king&rsquo;s private life.
Madame de Maintenon was the widow of the dramatist Scarron,
and first came into relationship with the king as governess to
his illegitimate children. She was a woman of unstained life
and strongly religious temperament; and it was by this that she
gained so great an influence over the king. Through her influence
the king was reconciled to his wife, and, when Maria Theresa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
died in 1683, Madame de Maintenon shortly afterwards (in 1684)
became the king&rsquo;s wife, though this was never officially declared.
Under her influence the court lost most of its gaiety, and
religion came to exercise much control over the life and the
policy of the king.</p>

<p>The first years of the king&rsquo;s rule were marked by the great
schemes of Colbert for the financial, commercial, industrial
and naval reorganization of France, and in these schemes Louis
took a deep interest. But in 1667 began the long series of wars,
which lasted with little real intermission to the end of the reign
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>). In the steps that led to these wars and in their
conduct the egotistic ambition and the vanity of the king played
an important part; though he never showed real military skill
and took no share in any military operations except in certain
sieges. The War of Devolution (or the Queen&rsquo;s War) in 1667-68
to enforce the queen&rsquo;s claim to certain districts in the Spanish
Netherlands, led to the Dutch War (1672-78), and in both these
wars the supremacy of the French armies was clearly apparent.
The next decade (1678-1688) was the real turning-point in the
history of the reign, and the strength of France was seriously
diminished. The chief cause of this is to be found in the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes. The church had always opposed
this settlement and had succeeded in altering it in many points.
Now the new religious zeal and the autocratic temper of Louis
XIV. came to the support of the church. The French Huguenots
found their privileges decreased, and then, in 1685, the edict was
altogether withdrawn. The results were ruinous to France. It
was not only that she lost many thousands of her best citizens,
but this blow against Protestantism deprived her of those
Protestant alliances in Europe which had been in the past her
great diplomatic support. Then the English Revolution came
in 1688 and changed England from a wavering ally into the most
determined of the enemies of France.</p>

<p>The war with the Grand Alliance, of which King William III.
was the heart and soul, lasted from 1688 to 1697; and the treaty
of Ryswick, which brought it to an end, deprived France of
certain territories on her frontier. But Louis saw in the Spanish
question a chance of more than making up for this loss. The
Spanish king Charles II. was dying, and the future of the
possessions of Spain was doubtful. The astute diplomacy of
Louis succeeded in winning the inheritance for his grandson
Philip. But this involved France and Europe in an immense
war (1700) and by the peace of Utrecht (1713), though the
French prince retained the Spanish crown, France had again to
make concessions of territory.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. had shown wonderful tenacity of purpose during
this disastrous war, and sometimes a nobler and more national
spirit than during the years of his triumphs. But the condition
of France was terrible. She was burdened with debt; the
reforms of Colbert were ruined; and opposition to the king&rsquo;s
régime began to make itself felt. Peace brought some relief to
France, but the last years of the king&rsquo;s life were gloomy in the
extreme. His numerous descendants seemed at one time to
place the succession <span class="correction" title="amended from beyong">beyond</span> all difficulty. But his eldest son,
the dauphin, died in April 1711; his eldest grandson the duke of
Burgundy in February 1712; and his great-grandson the duke
of Brittany in March 1712. The heir to the throne was now the
duke of Burgundy&rsquo;s son, the duke of Anjou, afterwards Louis XV.
The king died on the 1st of September 1715, after the longest
recorded reign in European history. The judgment of posterity
has not repeated the flattering verdict of his contemporaries;
but he remains the model of a great king in all that concerns the
externals of kingship.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The reign of Louis XIV. is particularly rich in memoirs describing
the life of the court. The chief are Madame de Motteville&rsquo;s memoirs
for the period of the Fronde, and the letters cf Madame de Sévigné
and the memoirs of Saint-Simon for the later period. The king&rsquo;s
ideas are best seen in the <i>Mémoires de Louis XIV. pour l&rsquo;instruction
du dauphin</i> (edited by Dreyss, 2 vols.). His private life is revealed
in the letters of Madame de Maintenon and in those of Madame,
Duchesse d&rsquo;Orléans. Of the ordinary historians of France Michelet
is fullest on the private life of the king. Mention may also be made
of Voltaire, <i>Siècle de Louis XIV.</i>; P. Clément, <i>Histoire de la vie et de

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS XV.<a name="ar86a" id="ar86a"></a></span> (1710-1774), king of France, was the great-grandson
of Louis XIV. and the third son of Louis, duke of Burgundy,
and Marie Adelaide, princess of Savoy. The first son had died
in 1705, and in 1712 the second son, the duke of Brittany, as
well as his father and mother, was carried off by a mysterious
disease. Louis was thus unexpectedly brought into the line
of the succession, and was only five years old when Louis XIV.
died. The dead king had endeavoured by his will to control
the administration even after his death by a carefully selected
council of regency, in which the duke of Orleans should have only
the nominal presidency; but with the help of the parlement
of Paris the arrangement was at once set aside, and the duke
was declared regent with full traditional powers. The duke
had capacity, but his life was so licentious that what influence
he had upon the king was for evil. Fleury, bishop of Fréjus,
was appointed his tutor, and the little king was sincerely attached
to him. The king attained his legal majority at the age of
thirteen, shortly before the death of the duke of Orleans. His
first minister was the incapable duke of Bourbon, who in 1725
procured the repudiation of the Spanish princess, to whom the
king had been betrothed, and his marriage to Maria Leszczynska,
daughter of the exiled king of Poland, then resident in Alsace.
In 1726 the duke of Bourbon was displaced by the king&rsquo;s tutor,
Bishop (afterwards Cardinal) Fleury, who exercised almost
absolute power, for the king took little interest in affairs of state.
His administration was successful and peaceful until the year
1734, when a disputed succession in Poland brought about the
interference of France on behalf of the queen&rsquo;s father. France
was unsuccessful in her immediate object, but at the peace of
Vienna (1735) secured the possession of Lorraine. Up to this
point the reign had been prosperous; but from this time on
it is a record of declining national strength, which was not
compensated by some days of military glory. Fleury&rsquo;s great
age (he died still in office at the age of ninety) prevented him
from really controlling the policy of France and of Europe.
In 1740 the war of the Austrian Succession broke out and
France drifted into it as an ally of Frederick of Prussia and
the enemy of England, and of Maria Theresa of Austria.</p>

<p>On Fleury&rsquo;s death in 1743 no one took his place, and the
king professed to adopt the example of Louis XIV. and to
establish a personal autocracy. But he was not strong enough
in will or intellect to give unity to the administration. The
marquis d&rsquo;Argenson writes that at the council table Louis
&ldquo;opened his mouth, said little and thought not at all,&rdquo; and
again that &ldquo;under the appearance of personal monarchy it
was really anarchy that reigned.&rdquo; He had followed too in his
domestic life the example of his predecessors. The queen for
some time seems to have secured his affections, and she bore
him seven children. But soon we hear of the royal mistresses.
The first to acquire notoriety was the duchess of Châteauroux,
the third sister of one family who held this position. She was
at least in part the cause of the only moment of popularity
which the king enjoyed. She urged him to take part personally
in the war. France had just received a humiliating check at
Dettingen, and the invasion of the north-eastern frontier was
feared. The king went to Metz in 1744, and his presence there
did something to ward off the danger. While the nation felt
genuine gratitude for his energy and its success, he was reported
to have fallen dangerously ill. The king, of whom it was said
that the fear of hell was the only part of religion which had
any reality for him, now dismissed the duchess of Châteauroux
and promised amendment. Prayers were offered everywhere
for his recovery, and the country was swept by a delirium of
loyal enthusiasm, which conferred on him the title of <i>Louis le
bien aimé</i>. But his future life disappointed all these hopes.
The duchess of Châteauroux died in the same year, but her place
was taken in 1745 by Madame de Pompadour. This woman
had philanthropic impulses and some real interest in art and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
letters; but her influence on public affairs was a fatal one.
She had many rivals during her lifetime and on her death in
1764 she was succeeded by Madame du Barry (<i>q.v.</i>). But
the mention of these three women gives no idea of the degradation
of the king&rsquo;s life. There has doubtless been exaggeration as
to certain details, and the story of his seraglio at the <i>Parc aux
cerfs</i> is largely apocryphal. But it would be difficult to mention
the name of any European king whose private life shows such
a record of vulgar vice unredeemed by higher aims of any kind.
He was not without ambition, but without sufficient tenacity
of purpose to come near to realizing it. To the last he maintained
the pretence of personal rule, but the machinery of
government fell out of gear, and the disorder of the finances was
never remedied before the revolution of 1789.</p>

<p>The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), which ended the war
of the Austrian Succession, brought no gains to France in spite
of her victories at Fontenoy and Raucoux; and the king was
blamed for the diplomatic failure. The interval between this
war and the Seven Years&rsquo; War (1756) saw that great reversal
of alliances which is sometimes called the &ldquo;Diplomatic Revolution&rdquo;;
whereby France repudiated the alliance of Frederick
the Great and joined hands with her old enemy Austria. The
intrigues of Madame de Pompadour played in this change an
important though not a decisive part. It was the cause of
immense disasters to France; for after a promising beginning,
both by land and sea, France suffered reverses which lost her
both India and Canada and deprived her of the leading position
which she had so long held in Europe. Her humiliation was
declared by the peace of Paris (1763).</p>

<p>The article on the history of France (<i>q.v.</i>) shows how there
arose during the last years of Louis XV.&rsquo;s reign a strong reaction
against the monarchy and its methods. Military success had
given it its strength; and its prestige was ruined by military
failure. In the parlements, provincial and Parisian; in religion
and in literature, a note of opposition is struck which was never
to die until the monarchy was overthrown. France annexed
Corsica in 1768, but this was felt to be the work of the minister
Chauvelin, and reflected no credit on the king. He died in 1774
of smallpox. If the reign of his predecessor shows us almost
the ideal of personal monarchy we may see in that of Louis
XV. all the vices and errors exemplified which lie in wait for
absolute hereditary rule which has survived the period of its
usefulness.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS XVI.<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (1754-1793), king of France, was the son of Louis,
dauphin of France, the son of Louis XV., and of Marie Joseph
of Saxony, and was born at Versailles on the 23rd of August
1754, being baptized as Louis Augustus. His father&rsquo;s death
in 1765 made him heir to the throne, and in 1770 he was married
to Marie Antoinette, daughter of the empress Maria Theresa.
He was just twenty years old when the death of Louis XV. on the
10th of May 1774 placed him on the throne. He began his reign
under good auspices, with Turgot, the greatest living French
statesman, in charge of the disorganized finances; but in less than
two years he had yielded to the demand of the vested interests
attacked by Turgot&rsquo;s reforms, and dismissed him. Turgot&rsquo;s
successor, Necker, however, continued the régime of reform
until 1781, and it was only with Necker&rsquo;s dismissal that the
period of reaction began. Marie Antoinette then obtained that
ascendancy over her husband which was partly responsible for
the extravagance of the ministry of Calonne, and brought on the
Revolution by the resulting financial embarrassment.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The
third part of his reign began with the meeting of the states-general
on the 4th of May 1789, which marked the opening of
the Revolution. The revolt of Paris and the taking of the Bastille
on the 14th of July were its results. The suspicion, not without
justification, of a second attempt at a <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> led on the
6th of October to the &ldquo;capture&rdquo; of the king and royal family
at Versailles by a mob from Paris, and their transference to the
Tuileries. In spite of the growing radicalism of the clubs, however,
loyalty to the king remained surprisingly strong. When he swore
to maintain the constitution, then in progress of construction, at
the festival of the federation on the 14th of July 1790, he was at
the height of his popularity. Even his attempted flight on the
20th of June 1791 did not entirely turn the nation against him,
although he left documents which proved his opposition to the
whole Revolution. Arrested at Varennes, and brought back to
Paris, he was maintained as a constitutional king, and took
his oath on the 13th of September 1791. But already a party
was forming in Paris which demanded his deposition. This
first became noticeable in connexion with the affair of the Champ
de Mars on the 17th of July 1791. Crushed for a time the party
gained strength through the winter of 1791-1792. The declaration
of war against the emperor Francis II., nephew of Marie
Antoinette, was forced upon the king by those who wished to
discredit him by failure, or to compel him to declare himself
openly an enemy to the Revolution. Their policy proved effective.
The failure of the war, which intensified popular hatred
of the Austrian queen, involved the king; and the invasion of
the Tuileries on the 20th of June 1792 was but the prelude to
the conspiracy which resulted, on the 10th of August, in the
capture of the palace and the &ldquo;suspension&rdquo; of royalty by the
Legislative Assembly until the convocation of a national convention
in September. On the 21st of September 1792 the
Convention declared royalty abolished, and in January it tried
the king for his treason against the nation, and condemned him
to death. He was executed on the 21st of January 1793.</p>

<p>Louis XVI. was weak in character and mentally dull. His
courage and dignity during his trial and on the scaffold has left
him a better reputation than he deserves. His diary shows
how little he understood, or cared for, the business of a king.
Days on which he had not shot anything at the hunt were
blank days for him. The entry on the 14th of July 1789 was
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo;! The greater part of his time was spent hunting.
He also amused himself making locks, and a little at masonry.
Awkward and uncourtly, at heart shy, he was but a poor figurehead
for the stately court of France. At first he did not care
for Marie Antoinette, but after he came under her influence,
her thoughtless conduct compromised him, and it was largely
she who encouraged him in underhand opposition to the
Revolution while he pretended to accept it. The only point
on which he had of his own initiative shown a strong objection
to revolutionary measures was in the matter of the civil
constitution of the clergy. A devoted and sincere Roman
Catholic, he refused at first to sanction a constitution for the
church in France without the pope&rsquo;s approval, and after he had
been compelled to allow the constitution to become law he
resolved to oppose the Revolution definitely by intrigues.
His policy was both feeble and false. He was singularly unfortunate
even when he gave in, delaying his acquiescence until
it had the air of a surrender. It is often said that Louis XVI.
was the victim of the faults of his predecessors. He was also the
victim of his own.</p>

<p>Having lost his elder son in 1789 Louis left two children, Louis
Charles, usually known as Louis XVII., and Marie Thérèse
Charlotte (1778-1851), who married her cousin, Louis, duke of
Angoulême, son of Charles X., in 1799. The &ldquo;orphan of the
Temple,&rdquo; as the princess was called, was in prison for three years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
during which time she remained ignorant of the fate which had
befallen her parents. She died on the 19th of October 1851.
Her life by G. Lenôtre has been translated into English by J. L.

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS XVII.<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1785-1795?), titular king of France, second son
of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette, was born at Versailles
on the 27th of March 1785, was christened the same day Louis
Charles, and given the title of duke of Normandy. Louis
Charles became dauphin on the death of his elder brother on the
4th of June 1789. It is only with his incarceration in the Temple
on the 13th of August 1792, that his history, apart from that of his
parents, becomes of interest. The royal party included, beside
the king and queen, their daughter Marie Thérèse Charlotte
(Madame Royale), the king&rsquo;s sister Madame Élisabeth, the valet
Cléry and others. The prisoners were lodged at first in the smaller
Tower, but were removed to the larger Tower on the 27th of
October. Louis Charles was then separated from his mother
and aunt to be put in his father&rsquo;s charge, except for a few hours
daily, but was restored to the women when Louis was isolated
from his family at the beginning of his trial in December.</p>

<p>On the 21st of January 1793 Louis became, for the royalists,
king of France, and a week later the comte de Provence arrogated
to himself the title of regent. From that moment began new
plots for the escape of the prisoners from the Temple, the chief
of which were engineered by the Chevalier de Jarjayes,<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the
baron de Batz,<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and the faithful Lady Atkyns.<a name="fa3n" id="fa3n" href="#ft3n"><span class="sp">3</span></a> On the 3rd of
July the little dauphin was again separated from his mother,
this time to be given into the keeping of the cobbler Antoine
Simon<a name="fa4n" id="fa4n" href="#ft4n"><span class="sp">4</span></a> who had been named his guardian by the Committee
of General Security. The tales told by the royalist writers of the
barbarous cruelty inflicted by Simon and his wife on the child are
not proven. Marie Jeanne, in fact, took great care of the child&rsquo;s
person, and there is documentary evidence to prove that he had
air and food. But the Simons were obviously grotesquely unfit
guardians for a prince, and they doubtless caused much suffering
to the impressionable child, who was made on occasion to eat and
drink to excess, and learnt the language of the gutter. But the
scenes related by A. de Beauchesne of the physical martyrdom
of the child are not supported by any other testimony, though
he was at this time seen by a great number of people. On the
6th of October Pache, Chaumette, Hébert and others visited
him and secured from him admissions of infamous accusations
against his mother, with his signature to a list of her alleged
crimes since her entry in the Temple, and next day he was confronted
with his sister Marie Thérèse for the last time.</p>

<p>Simon&rsquo;s wife now fell ill, and on the 19th of January 1794 the
Simons left the Temple, after securing a receipt for the safe transfer
of their prisoner, who was declared to be in good health.
A large part of the Temple records from that time onwards
were destroyed under the Restoration, so that exact knowledge
of the facts is practically impossible. Two days after the
departure of the Simons the prisoner is said by the Restoration
historians to have been put in a dark room which was barricaded
like the cage of a wild animal. The story runs that food was
passed through the bars to the child, who survived in spite of the
accumulated filth of his surroundings. Robespierre<a name="fa5n" id="fa5n" href="#ft5n"><span class="sp">5</span></a> visited
Marie Thérèse on the 11th of May, but no one, according to the
legend, entered the dauphin&rsquo;s room for six months until Barras
visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (July 27, 1794).
Barras&rsquo;s account of the visit describes the child as suffering from
extreme neglect, but conveys no idea of the alleged walling in.
It is nevertheless certain that during the first half of 1794 he was
very strictly secluded; he had no special guardian, but was under
the charge of guards changed from day to day. The child made
no complaint to Barras of his treatment, probably because he
feared to do so. He was then cleansed and re-clothed, his room
cleaned, and during the day he was visited by his new attendant,
a creole and a compatriot of Joséphine de Beauharnais, named
Jean Jacques Christophe Laurent (1770-1807), who had from
the 8th of November onwards assistance for his charge from
a man named Gomin. The child was now taken out to walk
on the roof of the Tower. From about the time of Gomin&rsquo;s
entrance the prisoner was inspected, not by delegates of the
Commune, but by representatives of the civil committee of the
48 sections of Paris. The rare recurrence of the same inspectors
would obviously facilitate fraud, if any such were intended.
From the end of October onwards the child maintained an
obstinate silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken
on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On the
19th of December 1794 he was visited by three commissioners
from the Committee of General Security&mdash;J. B. Harmand de la
Meuse, J. B. C. Mathieu and J. Reverchon&mdash;who extracted no
word from him. On Laurent&rsquo;s retirement Étienne Lasne was
appointed on the 31st of March 1795 to be the child&rsquo;s guardian.
In May 1795 the prisoner was seriously ill, and a doctor, P. J.
Desault, well acquainted with the dauphin, having visited him
seven months earlier, was summoned. Desault died suddenly,
not without suspicion of poison, on the 1st of June, and it was
some days before doctors Pelletan and Dumangin were called.
Then it was announced that on the 8th Louis Charles died.
Next day an autopsy was held at which it was stated that a child
apparently about ten years of age, &ldquo;which the commissioners
told us was the late Louis Capet&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; had died of a scrofulous
affection of long standing. He was buried on the 10th in the
cemetery of Ste Marguerite, but no stone was erected to mark
the spot.</p>

<p>The weak parts of this story are the sudden and unexplained
departure of the Simons; the subsequent useless cruelty of
treating the child like a wild beast and keeping him in a dark
room practically out of sight (unless any doubt of his identity
was possible), while his sister was in comparative comfort;
the cause of death, declared to be of long standing, but in fact
developed with such rapidity; the insufficient excuse provided
for the child&rsquo;s muteness under Gomin&rsquo;s régime (he had answered
Barras) and the irregularities in the formalities in attending
the death and the funeral, when a simple identification of the
body by Marie Thérèse would have prevented any question of
resuscitated dauphins. Both Barras and Harmand de la Meuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
are said to have given leave for the brother and sister to see each
other, but the meeting was never permitted. The argument
from the sudden disappearance of persons in a position to know
something of the truth is of a less convincing character. It may
be noted that the more famous of the persons alleged by partisans
of subsequent pretenders to have been hustled out of the world
for their connexion with the secret are the empress Joséphine,
the due d&rsquo;Enghien and the duc de Berri.</p>

<p>Immediately on the announcement of the dauphin&rsquo;s death
there arose a rumour that he had escaped. Simien-Despréaux,
one of Louis XVIII.&rsquo;s own authors, stated at a later period (1814)
that Louis XVII. was living and that among the signatories of
the treaty of April 13th were some who possessed proofs of his
existence; and Eckard, one of the mainstays of the official
account, left among his unpublished papers a statement that
many members of &ldquo;an assembly of our wise men&rdquo; obstinately
named Louis XVII. as the prince whom their wishes demanded.
Unfortunately the removal of the child suited the plans of the
comte de Provence (now Louis XVIII. for the <i>émigrés</i>) as well
as it suited the revolutionary government, and no serious attempt
was made by the royal family to ascertain the truth, though
they paid none of the tributes to the memory of the dead king
which might reasonably have been expected, had they been
convinced of his death. Even his sister wore no mourning for
him until she arrived at Vienna and saw that this was expected
of her. In spite of the massive literature which has
accumulated on the subject, neither his death in the Temple
nor his escape therefrom has been definitely established,
though a very strong presumption is established in favour of
the latter.</p>

<p>Some forty candidates for his honours were forthcoming
under the Restoration. The most important of these pretenders
were Karl Wilhelm Naundorff and the comte de Richemont.
Naundorff&rsquo;s story rested on a series of complicated intrigues.
According to him Barras determined to save the dauphin in
order to please Joséphine Beauharnais, the future empress,
having conceived the idea of using the dauphin&rsquo;s existence
as a means of dominating the comte de Provence in the event
of a restoration. The dauphin was concealed in the fourth storey
of the Tower, a wooden figure being substituted for him. Laurent,
to protect himself from the consequences of the substitution,
replaced the wooden figure by a deaf mute, who was presently
exchanged for the scrofulous child of the death certificate.
The deaf mute was also concealed in the Temple. It was not the
dead child, but the dauphin who left the prison in the coffin,
whence he was extracted by his friends on the way to the
cemetery. Richemont&rsquo;s tale that the woman Simon, who was
genuinely attached to him, smuggled him out in a basket, is
simple and more credible, and does not necessarily invalidate
the story of the subsequent operations with the deaf mute and
the scrofulous patient, Laurent in that case being deceived
from the beginning, but it renders them extremely unlikely.
A third pretender, Eleazar Williams, did not affect to know
anything of his escape. He possessed, he said, no consciousness
of his early years, only emerging from idiocy at the age of thirteen,
when he was living with an Indian family in New York State.
He was a missionary to the Indians when the prince de Joinville,
son of Louis Philippe, met him, and after some conversation
asked him to sign a document abdicating his rights in favour of
Louis Philippe, in return for which he, the dauphin (alias
Eleazar Williams), was to receive the private inheritance which
was his. This Eleazar refused to do. The wildness of this tale
refutes itself.</p>

<p>Richemont (Henri Ethelbert Louis Victor Hébert) was in
prison in Milan for seven years and began to put forward his
claims in Paris in 1828. In 1833 he was again arrested, was
brought to trial in the following year and was condemned to
twelve years&rsquo; imprisonment. He escaped after a few months and
left the country, to return in 1840. He died at Gleize on the
10th of August 1853, the name of Louis Charles de France
being inscribed on his tomb until the government ordered its
removal.</p>

<p>Naundorff, or Naündorff, who had arrived from nowhere in
Berlin in 1810, with papers giving the name Karl Wilhelm
Naundorff, in order to escape the persecutions of which he
declared himself the object, settled at Spandau in 1812 as a
clockmaker, and married in 1818 Johanna Einert. In 1822 he
removed to Brandenburg, and in 1828 to Crossen, near Frankfort.
He was imprisoned from 1825 to 1828 for coining, though
apparently on insufficient evidence, and in 1833 came to push his
claims in Paris, where he was recognized as the dauphin by many
persons formerly connected with the court of Louis XVI. Expelled
from France in 1836, the day after bringing a suit against
the duchess of Angoulême for the restitution of the dauphin&rsquo;s
private property, he lived in exile till his death at Delft on the
10th of August 1845, and his tomb was inscribed &ldquo;Louis XVII.,
roi de France et de Navarre (Charles Louis, duc de Normandie).&rdquo;
The Dutch authorities who had inscribed on his death certificate
the name of Charles Louis de Bourbon, duc de Normandie (Louis
XVII.) permitted his son to bear the name de Bourbon, and when
the family appealed in 1850-1851, and again in 1874, for the
restitution of their civil rights as heirs of Louis XVI. no less an
advocate than Jules Favre pleaded their cause. Of all the pretenders
Naundorff has the best case. He was certainly not the
Jew of Prussian Poland which his enemies declared him to be,
and he has to this day a circle of devoted adherents. Since he
was sincerely convinced of his own rights, it is surprising that
he put forward no claim in 1814.</p>

<p>If the dauphin did escape, it seems probable that he perished
shortly afterwards or lived in a safe obscurity. The account of
the substitution in the Temple is well substantiated, even to
the names of the substitutes. The curious imbroglio deceived
royalists and republicans alike. Lady Atkyns was trying by
every possible means to get the dauphin out of his prison when
he was apparently already in safe hands, if not outside the Temple
walls. A child was in fact delivered to her agents, but he was a
deaf mute. That there was fraud, and complicated fraud, in the
guardians of the dauphin may be taken as proved by a succession
of writers from 1850 onwards, and more recently by Frédéric
Barbey, who wisely attempts no ultimate solution. When the
partisans of Richemont or Naundorff come to the post-Temple
careers of their heroes, they become in most cases so uncritical
as to be unconvincing.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The official version of the dauphin&rsquo;s history as accepted under the
Restoration was drawn up by Simien Despréaux in his uncritical
<i>Louis XVII.</i> (1817), and is found, fortified by documents, in M.
Eckard&rsquo;s <i>Mémoires historiques sur Louis XVII</i>. (1817) and in A. de
Beauchesne&rsquo;s <i>Louis XVII., sa vie, son agonie, sa mort. Captivité
de la famille royale au Temple</i> (2 vols., 1852, and many subsequent
editions), containing copies of original documents, and essential to
the study of the question, although its sentimental pictures of the
boy martyr can no longer be accepted. L. de la Sicotière, &ldquo;Les faux
Louis XVII.,&rdquo; in <i>Revue des questions historiques</i> (vol. xxxii., 1882),
deals with the pretenders Jean Marie Hervagault, Mathurin Bruneau
and the rest; see also Dr Cabanes, <i>Les Morts mystérieuses de l&rsquo;histoire</i>
(1901), and revised catalogue of the J. Sanford Saltus collection of
Louis XVII. books (New York, 1908). Catherine Welch, in <i>The
Little Dauphin</i> (1908) gives a résumé of the various sides of the
question.</p>

<p>Madame Royale&rsquo;s own account of the captivity of the Temple
was first printed with additions and suppressions in 1817, and often
subsequently, the best edition being that from her autograph text
by G. Lenôtre, <i>La Fille de Louis XVI., Marie Thérèse Charlotte de
France, duchesse d&rsquo;Angoulême, le Temple, l&rsquo;échange, l&rsquo;exil</i> (1907).
There are two collections of writings on the subject: <i>Marie Thérèse
de France</i>, compiled (1852) by the marquis de Pastoret, and comprising

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS XVIII.<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Louis le Désiré</span>) (1755-1824). Louis-Stanislas-Xavier,
comte de Provence, third son of the dauphin
Louis, son of Louis XV., and of Maria Josepha of Saxony, was
born at Versailles on the 17th of November 1755. His education
was supervised by the devout duc de la Vauguyon, but his own
taste was for the writings of Voltaire and the encyclopaedists.
On the 14th of May 1771 took place his marriage with Louise-Marie-Joséphine
of Savoy, by whom he had no children. His
position at court was uncomfortable, for though ambitious and
conscious of possessing greater abilities than his brother (Louis
XVI.), his scope for action was restricted; he consequently
devoted his energies largely to intrigue, especially against
Marie Antoinette, whom he hated.<a name="fa1o" id="fa1o" href="#ft1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a> During the long absence
of heirs to Louis XVI., &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; as heir to the throne, courted
popularity and took an active part in politics, but the birth of
a dauphin (1781) was a blow to his ambitions.<a name="fa2o" id="fa2o" href="#ft2o"><span class="sp">2</span></a> He opposed
the revival of the <i>parlements</i>, wrote a number of political
pamphlets,<a name="fa3o" id="fa3o" href="#ft3o"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and at the Assembly of Notables presided, like the
other princes of the blood, over a bureau, to which was given the
name of the <i>Comité des sages</i>; he also advocated the double
representation of the <i>tiers</i>. At the same time he cultivated
literature, entertaining poets and writers both at the Luxembourg
and at his château of Brunoy (see Dubois-Corneau, <i>Le Comte de
Provence à Brunoy</i>, 1909), and gaining a reputation for wit by
his verses and <i>mots</i> in the salon of the charming and witty
comtesse de Balbi, one of Madame&rsquo;s ladies, who had become
his mistress,<a name="fa4o" id="fa4o" href="#ft4o"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and till 1793 exerted considerable influence over
him. He did not emigrate after the taking of the Bastille, but,
possibly from motives of ambition, remained in Paris. Mirabeau
thought at one time of making him chief minister in his projected
constitutional government (see <i>Corr. de Mirabeau et La Marck</i>, ed.
Bacourt, i. 434, 436, 442), but was disappointed by his caution
and timidity. The <i>affaire Favras</i> (Dec. 1789) aroused great
feeling against Monsieur, who was believed by many to have
conspired with Favras, only to abandon him (see Lafayette&rsquo;s
<i>Mems.</i> and <i>Corr. of Mirabeau</i>). In June 1791, at the time of the
flight to Varennes, Monsieur also fled by a different route,
and, in company with the comte d&rsquo;Avaray<a name="fa5o" id="fa5o" href="#ft5o"><span class="sp">5</span></a>&mdash;who subsequently
replaced Mme de Balbi as his confidant, and largely influenced
his policy during the emigration&mdash;succeeded in reaching Brussels,
where he joined the comte d&rsquo;Artois and proceeded to Coblenz,
which now became the headquarters of the emigration.</p>

<p>Here, living in royal state, he put himself at the head of
the counter-revolutionary movement, appointing ambassadors,
soliciting the aid of the European sovereigns, and especially
of Catherine II. of Russia. Out of touch with affairs in France
and surrounded by violent anti-revolutionists, headed by
Calonne and the comte d&rsquo;Artois, he followed an entirely selfish
policy, flouting the National Assembly (see his reply to the
summons of the National Assembly, in Daudet, <i>op. cit.</i> i. 96),
issuing uncompromising manifestoes (Sept. 1791, Aug. 1792, &amp;c.),
and obstructing in every way the representatives of the king and
queen.<a name="fa6o" id="fa6o" href="#ft6o"><span class="sp">6</span></a> After Valmy he had to retire to Hamm in Westphalia,
where, on the death of Louis XVI., he proclaimed himself regent;
from here he went south, with the idea of encouraging the
royalist feeling in the south of France, and settled at Verona,
where on the death of Louis XVII. (8th of June 1795) he took
the title of Louis XVIII. At this time ended his <i>liaison</i> with
Mme de Balbi, and the influence of d&rsquo;Avaray reached its height.
From this time onward his life is a record of constant wanderings,
negotiations and conspiracies. In April 1796 he joined Condé&rsquo;s
army on the German frontier, but was shortly requested to leave
the country, and accepted the hospitality of the duke of Brunswick
at Blanckenberg till 1797, when, this refuge being no longer
open to him, the emperor Paul I. permitted him to settle at
Mittau in Courland, where he stayed till 1801. All this time
he was in close communication with the royalists in France, but
was much embarrassed by the conflicting policy pursued by the
comte d&rsquo;Artois from England, and was largely at the mercy
of corrupt and dishonest agents.<a name="fa7o" id="fa7o" href="#ft7o"><span class="sp">7</span></a> At Mittau was realized his
cherished plan of marrying Madame Royale, daughter of Louis
XVI., to the duc d&rsquo;Angoulême, elder son of the comte d&rsquo;Artois.
From Mittau, too, was sent his well-known letter to Bonaparte
(1799) calling upon him to play the part of Monk, a proposal
contemptuously refused (E. Daudet, <i>Hist. de l&rsquo;émigration</i>, ii.
371, 436), though Louis in turn declined to accept a pension from
Bonaparte, and later, in 1803, though his fortunes were at their
lowest ebb, refused to abdicate at his suggestion and accept
an indemnity.</p>

<p>Suddenly expelled from Mittau in 1801 by the capricious
Paul I., Louis made his way, in the depth of winter, to Warsaw,
where he stayed for three years. All this time he was trying
to convert France to the royalist cause, and had a &ldquo;<i>conseil
royal</i>&rdquo; in Paris, founded at the end of 1799 by Royer-Collard,
Montesquiou and Clermont-Gallerande, the actions of which
were much impeded by the activity of the rival committee of
the comte d&rsquo;Artois (see E. Daudet, <i>op. cit.</i> ii., and Remâcle,
<i>Bonaparte et les Bourbons</i>, Paris, 1899), but after 1800, and still
more after the failure of the royalist conspiracy of Cadoudal,
Pichegru and Moreau, followed by the execution of the duc
d&rsquo;Enghien (March 1804), and the assumption by Napoleon of
the title of emperor (May 1804), the royalist cause appeared
quite hopeless. In September 1804 Louis met the comte d&rsquo;Artois
at Calmar in Sweden, and they issued a protest against Napoleon&rsquo;s
action, but being warned that he must not return to Poland, he
gained permission from Alexander I. again to retire to Mittau.
After Tilsit, however (1807), he was again forced to depart, and
took refuge in England, where he stayed first at Gosfield in Essex,
and afterwards (1809 onwards) at Hartwell in Buckinghamshire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
In 1810 his wife died, and in 1811 d&rsquo;Avaray died, his place as
favourite being taken by the comte de Blacas.<a name="fa8o" id="fa8o" href="#ft8o"><span class="sp">8</span></a> After Napoleon&rsquo;s
defeats in 1813 the hopes of the royalists revived, and Louis
issued a fresh manifesto, in which he promised to recognize the
results of the Revolution. Negotiations were also opened with
Bernadotte, who seemed willing to support his cause, but was
really playing for his own hand.</p>

<p>In March 1814 the Allies entered Paris, and thanks to Talleyrand&rsquo;s
negotiations the restoration of the Bourbons was effected,
Louis XVIII. entering Paris on the 2nd of May 1814, after issuing
the declaration of St Ouen, in which he promised to grant the
nation a constitution (<i>octroyer une charte</i>). He was now nearly
sixty, wearied by adversity, and a sufferer from gout and obesity.
But though clear-sighted, widely read and a good diplomatist,
his impressionable and sentimental nature made him too subject
to personal and family influences. His concessions to the
reactionary and clerical party of the <i>émigrés</i>, headed by the
comte d&rsquo;Artois and the duchesse d&rsquo;Angoulême, aroused suspicions
of his loyalty to the constitution, the creation of his <i>Maison
militaire</i> alienated the army, and the constant presence of Blacas
made the formation of a united ministry impossible. After
the Hundred Days, during which the king was forced to flee to
Ghent, the dismissal of Blacas was made one of the conditions
of his second restoration. On the 8th of July he again entered
Paris, &ldquo;in the baggage train of the allied armies,&rdquo; as his enemies
said, but in spite of this was received with the greatest enthusiasm<a name="fa9o" id="fa9o" href="#ft9o"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
by a people weary of wars and looking for constitutional government.
He was forced to retain Talleyrand and Fouché in his
first ministry, but took the first opportunity of ridding himself
of them when the elections of 1815 assured him of a strong
royalist majority in the chamber (the <i>chambre introuvable</i>,
a name given it by Louis himself). At this time he came into
contact with the young comte (afterwards duc) Decazes, prefect
of the police under Fouché, and minister of police in Richelieu&rsquo;s
ministry, who now became his favourite and gained his entire
confidence (see E. Daudet, <i>Louis XVIII. et le duc Decazes</i>).
Having obtained a ministry in which he could trust, having
as members the duc de Richelieu and Decazes, the king now
gave it his loyal support and did his best to shield his ministers
from the attacks of the royal family. In September 1816,
alarmed at the violence of the <i>chambre introuvable</i>, he was
persuaded to dissolve it. An attempt on the part of the
Ultras to regain their ascendancy over the king, by conniving
at the sudden return of Blacas from Rome to Paris,<a name="fa10o" id="fa10o" href="#ft10o"><span class="sp">10</span></a> ended in
failure.</p>

<p>The events and ministerial changes of Louis XVIII.&rsquo;s reign
are described under the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: <i>History</i>, but it may be
said here that the king&rsquo;s policy throughout was one of prudence
and common sense. His position was more passive than active,
and consisted in giving his support as far as possible to the
ministry of the day. While Decazes was still in power, the king&rsquo;s
policy to a large extent followed his, and was rather liberal and
moderate, but after the assassination of the duc de Berry (1820),
when he saw that Decazes could no longer carry on the government,
he sorrowfully acquiesced in his departure, showered
honours upon him, and transferred his support to Richelieu,
the head of the new ministry. In the absence of Decazes a new
favourite was found to amuse the king&rsquo;s old age, Madame du
Cayla (Zoé Talon, comtesse du Cayla), a protégée of the vicomte
Sosthène de la Rochefoucauld and consequently a creature of
the Ultras. As the king became more and more infirm, his power
of resistance to the intrigues of the Ultras became weaker. The
birth of a posthumous son to the duc de Berry (Sept. 1820), the
death of Napoleon (5th of May 1821) and the resignation of
Richelieu left him entirely in their hands, and after Villèle had
formed a ministry of a royalist character the comte d&rsquo;Artois
was associated with the government, which passed more and
more out of the king&rsquo;s hands. He died on the 16th of September
1824, worn out in body, but still retaining flashes of his former
clear insight and scepticism. The character of Louis XVIII.
may be summed up in the words of Bonaparte, quoted by Sorel
(<i>L&rsquo;Europe et la Rév. fr.</i> viii. 416 footnote), &ldquo;C&rsquo;est Louis XVI.
avec moins de franchise et plus d&rsquo;esprit.&rdquo; He had all the Bourbon
characteristics, especially their love of power, combined with a
certain nobility of demeanour, and a consciousness of his dignity
as king. But his nature was cold, unsympathetic and calculating,
combined with a talent for intrigue, to which was added an
excellent memory and a ready wit. An interesting judgment
of him is contained in <i>Queen Victoria&rsquo;s Letters</i>, vol. i., in a letter
of Leopold I., king of the Belgians, to the queen before her
accession, dated the 18th of November 1836, &ldquo;Poor Charles X.
is dead.... History will state that Louis XVIII. was a most
liberal monarch, reigning with great mildness and justice to
his end, but that his brother, from his despotic and harsh disposition,
upset all the other had done and lost the throne. Louis
XVIII. was a clever, hard-hearted man, shackled by no principle,
very proud and false. Charles X. an honest man, a kind friend,&rdquo;
&amp;c. &amp;c. This seems fairly just as a personal estimate, though
it does not do justice to their respective political rôles.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;There is no trustworthy or complete edition of
the writings and correspondence of Louis XVIII. The <i>Mémoires
de Louis XVIII. recueillis et mis en ordre par M. le duc de D. ...</i>
(12 vols., Paris, 1832-1833) are compiled by Lamothe-Langon, a
well-known compiler of more or less apocryphal memoirs. From
the hand of Louis XVIII. are: <i>Relation d&rsquo;un voyage à Bruxelles et à
Coblentz</i>, 1791 (Paris, 1823, with dedication to d&rsquo;Avaray); and
<i>Journal de Marie-Thérèse de France, duchesse d&rsquo;Angoulême, corrigé et
annoté par Louis XVIII.</i>, ed. Imbert de St Amand (Paris, 1896).
Some of his letters are contained in collections, such as <i>Lettres

di Borgo avec le comte de Nesselrode</i> (2 vols., 1890-1897), the correspondence
of C. de Rémusat, Villèle, &amp;c. The works of E. Daudet
are of the greatest importance, and based on original documents;
the chief are: <i>La Terreur Blanche</i> (Paris, 1878); <i>Hist. de la restauration
1814-1830</i> (1882); <i>Louis XVIII. et le duc Decazes</i> (1899); <i>Hist.

(ii.) <i>Les Émigrés et la seconde coalition</i> (1886), (iii.) <i>Coblenz</i>, 1789-1793
(1890). Developed from these with the addition of much further
material is his <i>Hist. de l&rsquo;émigration</i> (3 vols., 1904-1907). Also based
on original documents is E. Romberg and A. Malet, <i>Louis XVIII. et

former entrance. Indeed, during the long audience to which we were
admitted, it was almost impossible to converse, so loud were the
shouts of the people in the Thuilleries Gardens, which were full,
though it was then dark. Previous to the king&rsquo;s dismissing us, he
carried the duke and me to the open window. Candles were then
brought, which enabled the people to see the king with the duke
by his side. They ran from all parts of the Gardens, and formed a
solid mass of an immense extent, rending the air with acclamations.
The town is very generally illuminated, and I understand from men
who have traversed the principal streets that every demonstration
of joy was manifested by the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS I.<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (1326-1382), called &ldquo;the great,&rdquo; king of Hungary
and Poland, was the third son of Charles Robert, king of Hungary,
and Elizabeth, daughter of the Polish king, Ladislaus Lokietek.
In 1342 he succeeded his father as king of Hungary and was
crowned at Székesfehérvár on the 21st of July with great enthusiasm.
Though only sixteen he understood Latin, German
and Italian as well as his mother tongue. He owed his relatively
excellent education to the care of his mother, a woman of profound
political sagacity, who was his chief counsellor in diplomatic
affairs during the greater part of his long reign. Italian
politics first occupied his attention. As a ruler of a rising
great power in search of a seaboard he was the natural adversary
of the Venetian republic, which already aimed at making the
Adriatic a purely Venetian sea and resented the proximity of
the Magyars in Dalmatia. The first trial of strength began in
1345, when the city of Zara placed herself under the protection
of Hungary and was thereupon invested by the Venetians.
Louis fought a battle beneath the walls of Zara (July 1st, 1346),
which has been immortalized by Tintoretto, but was defeated
and compelled to abandon the city to the republic. The struggle
was renewed eleven years later when Louis, having formed, with
infinite trouble, a league of all the enemies of Venice, including
the emperor, the Habsburgs, Genoa and other Italian towns,
attacked his maritime rival with such vigour that she sued for
peace, and by the treaty of Zara (February 18th, 1358) ceded
most of the Dalmatian towns and renounced the title of duke
of Dalmatia and Croatia, hitherto borne by the doge. Far
more important than the treaty itself was the consequent voluntary
submission of the independent republic of Ragusa to the
suzerainty of the crown of St Stephen the same year, Louis,
in return for an annual tribute of 500 ducats and a fleet, undertaking
to defend Ragusa against all her enemies. Still more
glorious for Hungary was Louis&rsquo;s third war with Venice (1378-1381),
when he was again aided by the Genoese. At an early
stage of the contest Venice was so hardly pressed that she offered
to do homage to Hungary for all her possessions. But her
immense resources enabled her to rally her forces, and peace
was finally concluded between all the powers concerned at the
congress of Turin (1381), Venice virtually surrendering Dalmatia
to Louis and undertaking to pay him an annual tribute of 7000
ducats. The persistent hostility of Venice is partially attributable
to her constant fear lest Louis should inherit the crown
of Naples and thus threaten her trade and her sea-power from
two sides simultaneously. Louis&rsquo;s younger brother Andrew
had wedded Joanna, granddaughter and heiress of old King
Robert of Naples, on whose death, in 1343, she reigned in her
own right, refused her consort any share in the government,
and is very strongly suspected of having secured his removal
by assassination on the night of the 19th of September 1345.
She then married Prince Louis of Taranto, and strong in the
double support of the papal court at Avignon and of the Venetian
republic (both of whom were opposed to Magyar aggrandisement
in Italy) questioned the right of Louis to the two Sicilies, which
he claimed as the next heir of his murdered brother. In 1347,
and again in 1350, Louis occupied Naples and craved permission
to be crowned king, but the papal see was inexorable
and he was compelled to withdraw. The matter was not decided
till 1378 when Joanna, having made the mistake of recognizing
the antipope Clement VII., was promptly deposed and excommunicated
in favour of Prince Charles of Durazzo, who had
been brought up at the Hungarian court. Louis, always inexhaustible
in expedients, determined to indemnify himself
in the north for his disappointments in the south. With the
Habsburgs, Hungary&rsquo;s natural rivals in the west, Louis generally
maintained friendly relations. From 1358 to 1368, however,
the restless ambition of Rudolph, duke of Austria, who acquired
Tirol and raised Vienna to the first rank among the cities of
Europe, caused Louis great uneasiness. But Louis always
preferred arbitration to war, and the peace congresses of Nagyszombat
(1360) and of Pressburg (1360) summoned by him
adjusted all the outstanding differences between the central
European powers. Louis&rsquo;s diplomacy, moreover, was materially
assisted by his lifelong alliance with his uncle, the childless
Casimir the Great of Poland, who had appointed him his successor;
and on Casimir&rsquo;s death Louis was solemnly crowned king
of Poland at Cracow (Nov. 17, 1370). This personal union
of the two countries was more glorious than profitable. Louis
could give little attention to his unruly Polish subjects and
was never very happy among them. Immovably entrenched
behind their privileges, they rendered him only the minimum
of service; but he compelled their representatives, assembled at
Kassa, to recognize his daughter Maria and her affianced husband,
Count Sigismund of Brandenburg, as their future king and
queen by locking the gates of the city and allowing none to leave
it till they had consented to his wishes (1374). Louis is the first
European monarch who came into collision with the Turks.
He seems to have arrested their triumphant career (<i>c.</i> 1372),
and the fine church erected by him at Maria-Zell is a lasting
memorial of his victories. From the first he took a just view
of the Turkish peril, but the peculiar local and religious difficulties
of the whole situation in the Balkans prevented him from
dealing with it effectually (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hungary</a></span>, <i>History</i>). Louis died
suddenly at Nagyszombat on the 10th of September 1382. He
left two daughters Maria and Jadwiga (the latter he destined
for the throne of Hungary) under the guardianship of his widow,
the daughter of the valiant ban of Bosnia, Stephen Kotromaníc,
whom he married in 1353, and who was in every way worthy
of him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS II.<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1506-1526), king of Hungary and Bohemia, was
the only son of Wladislaus II., king of Hungary and Bohemia,
and the French princess Anne of Candale. Prematurely born
at Buda on the 1st of July 1506, it required all the resources of
medical science to keep the sickly child alive, yet he developed
so precociously that at the age of thirteen he was well bearded
and moustached, while at eighteen his hair was silvery white.
His parts were good and he could speak and write six languages
at a very early age, but the zeal of his guardians and tutors
to make a man of him betimes nearly ruined his feeble constitution,
while the riotous life led by him and his young consort,
Maria of Austria, whom he wedded on the 13th of January 1522,
speedily disqualified him for affairs, so that at last he became
an object of ridicule at his own court. He was crowned king of
Hungary on the 4th of June 1508, and king of Bohemia on the
11th of May 1509, and was declared of age when he succeeded
his father on the 11th of December 1521. But during the greater
part of his reign he was the puppet of the magnates and kept
in such penury that he was often obliged to pawn his
jewels to get proper food and clothing. His guardians, Cardinal
Bakócz and Count George of Brandenburg-Anspach, shamefully
neglected him, squandered the royal revenues and distracted
the whole kingdom with their endless dissensions. Matters
grew even worse on the death of Bakócz, when the magnates
István Báthory, János Zapolya and István Verböczy fought
each other furiously, and used the diets as their tools. Added to
these troubles was the ever-present Turkish peril, which became
acute after the king, with insensate levity, arrested the Ottoman
envoy Berham in 1521 and refused to unite with Suleiman in a
league against the Habsburgs. Nevertheless in the last extremity
Louis showed more of manhood than any of his counsellors.
It was he who restored something like order by intervening
between the magnates and the gentry at the diet of 1525.
It was he who collected in his camp at Tolna the army of 25,000
men which perished utterly on the fatal field of Mohács on
the 29th of August 1526. He was drowned in the swollen
stream of Csele on his flight from the field, being the second

Hungary.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS,<a name="ar91a" id="ar91a"></a></span> the name of three kings of Naples, members of the
house of Anjou.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Louis I.</span>, duke of Anjou and count of Maine (1339-1384), was
the second son of John II., king of France, and was born at
Vincennes on the 23rd of July 1339. Having been given the
duchy of Anjou in 1356 he led a wing of the French army at the
battle of Poitiers and was sent to England as a hostage after the
conclusion of the treaty of Brétigny in 1360, but he broke his
parole in 1363 and so brought about King John&rsquo;s return into
captivity. He took part in the war against England which was
renewed in 1369, uniting the rival houses of Foix and Armagnac
in the common cause, and in other ways rendering good service
to his brother, King Charles V. Anjou&rsquo;s entrance into the
troubled politics of Italy was one result of the papal schism
which opened in 1378. Anxious to secure the support of France,
the antipope Clement VII. persuaded the queen of Naples,
Joanna I., to name Louis as her heir, and about the same time
the death of Charles V. (September 1380) placed the duke in
the position of regent of France. Neglecting France to prosecute
his ambitions in Italy, he collected money and marched on
Naples; but although helped by Amadeus VI., count of Savoy,
he was unable to drive his rival, Charles, duke of Durazzo, from
Naples. His army was destroyed by disease and Louis himself
died at Biseglia, near Bari, on the 20th of September 1384,
leaving two sons, his successor, Louis II., and Charles, duke of
Calabria.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Louis II.</span>, duke of Anjou (1377-1417), born at Toulon on the
7th of October 1377, took up the struggle for Naples after his
father&rsquo;s death and was crowned king by Clement VII. in 1389.
After carrying on the contest for some years his enemies prevailed
and he was compelled to take refuge in France, where he took
part in the intestine strife which was desolating that kingdom.
A few years later he made other attempts to secure the kingdom
of Naples, which was now in the possession of Ladislas, a son of
his father&rsquo;s foeman, Charles of Durazzo, and he gained a victory
at Roccoserra in May 1411. Soon, however, he was again driven
back to France, and after sharing anew in the civil wars of his
country he died at Angers on the 29th of April 1417. His wife
was Yolande, a daughter of John I., king of Aragon, and his
son was his successor, Louis III.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Louis III.</span>, duke of Anjou (1403-1434), born on the 25th of
September 1403, made in his turn an attempt to conquer Naples.
This was in 1420, and he had met with considerable success in his
task when he died at Cosenza on the 15th of November 1434. In
1424 Louis received from King Charles VII. the duchy of Touraine.</p>

<p>Another titular king of Naples of this name was Louis, a son of
Philip, prince of Taranto. In 1346 he became the husband of
Joanna I., queen of Naples, and in 1352 he was crowned king.
After making an attempt to conquer Sicily he died on the 26th
of May 1362.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (893-911), surnamed the &ldquo;Child,&rdquo; king of the Franks,
son of the emperor Arnulf, was born at Ottingen, designated by
Arnulf as his successor in Germany in 897, and crowned on the
4th of February 900. Although he never received the imperial
crown, he is sometimes referred to as the emperor Louis IV. His
chief adviser was Hatto I., archbishop of Mainz; and during his
reign the kingdom was ravaged by Hungarians and torn with
internal strife. He appears to have passed his time in journeys
from place to place, and in 910 was the nominal leader of an
expedition against the Hungarians which was defeated near
Augsburg. Louis, who was the last of the German Carolingians,
died in August or September 911 and was buried at Regensburg.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS OF NASSAU<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1538-1574), son of William, count of
Nassau, and Juliana von Stolberg, and younger brother of
William the Silent, took an active part in the revolt of the Netherlands
against Spanish domination. He was one of the leaders
of the league of nobles who signed the document known as &ldquo;the
Compromise&rdquo; in 1566, and a little later was a member of the
deputation who presented the petition of grievances called &ldquo;the
Request&rdquo; to the regent, Margaret of Parma. It was on this
occasion that the appellation of &ldquo;the Beggars&rdquo; (<i>les Gueux</i>) was
first given to the opponents of King Philip&rsquo;s policy. On the
arrival of Alva at Brussels, Count Louis, with his brother
William, withdrew from the Netherlands and raised a body of
troops in defence of the patriot cause. In the spring of 1568
Louis invaded Friesland, and at Heiligerlee, on the 23rd of May,
completely defeated a Spanish force under Count Aremberg, who
was killed. Alva then advanced to meet the invaders with a
large army, and at Jemmingen (July 21), with very slight loss,
annihilated the levies of Louis, who himself escaped by swimming
from the field across an estuary of the Ems. He now joined the
army of his brother William, which had in October to beat a
hasty retreat before Alva&rsquo;s superior skill. Then Louis, in
company with his brothers William and Henry, made his way
across the French frontier to the camp of the Huguenot leader,
Admiral Coligny. Louis took an active part in the campaign
and fought heroically at Jarnac and Moncontour. In 1572
Louis, not deterred by previous disaster, raised a small force in
France, and, suddenly entering Hainaut, captured Mons (May 23).
Here he was besieged by Don Frederick of Toledo, Alva&rsquo;s natural
son, who blockaded all approach to the town. William made an
attempt to relieve his brother, but failed, and Mons had to
surrender (September 17). Louis, who was sick with fever, withdrew
to his ancestral home, Dillenburg, to recruit his health,
and then once more to devote his energies to the raising of money
and troops for another invasion of the Netherlands. In the hope
of drawing away the Spaniards from the siege of Leiden by a
diversion in the south, Louis, with his brothers John and Henry,
at the head of a force of mixed nationalities and little discipline,
crossed the frontier near Maastricht, and advanced as far as the
Mookerheide near Nijmwegen. Here he was attacked by a body
of Spanish veterans under an experienced leader, Sancho d&rsquo;Avila,
and speedily routed. In the disorderly flight both Louis and his
younger brother Henry, refusing to abandon the field, lost their
lives. Their bodies were never recovered. Thus perished at the
age of thirty-six one of the most chivalrous and gifted of a gallant
band of brothers, four of whom laid down their lives in their
country&rsquo;s cause.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUIS, JOSEPH DOMINIQUE,<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1755-1837), French
statesman and financier, was born at Toul (Meurthe) on the
13th of November 1755. At the outbreak of the Revolution the
abbé Louis (he had early taken orders) had already some reputation
as a financial expert. He was in favour of the constitutional
movement, and on the great festival of federation (July 14, 1790)
he assisted Talleyrand, then bishop of Autun, to celebrate
mass at the altar erected in the Champ de Mars. In 1792,
however, he emigrated to England, where he spent his time
studying English institutions and especially the financial system
of Pitt. Returning to France on the establishment of the
Consulate he served successively in the ministry of war, the
council of state, and in the finance department in Holland and
in Paris. Made a baron of the empire in 1809 he nevertheless
supported the Bourbon restoration and was minister of finance
in 1814-1815. Baron Louis was deputy from 1815 to 1824 and
from 1827 to 1832. He resumed the portfolio of finance in 1815,
which he held also in the Decazes ministry of 1818; he was
the first minister of finance under the government of Louis
Philippe, and held the same portfolio in 1831-1832. In 1832 he
was made a peer of France and he died on the 26th of August
1837.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">LOUIS PHILIPPE I.,<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> king of the French (1773-1850), was the
eldest son of Louis Philip Joseph, duke of Orleans (known
during the Revolution as Philippe Egalité) and of Louise Marie
Adelaide de Bourbon, daughter of the duc de Penthièvre, and
was born at the Palais Royal in Paris on the 6th of October 1773.
On his father&rsquo;s side he was descended from the brother of Louis
XIV., on his mother&rsquo;s from the count of Toulouse, &ldquo;legitimated&rdquo;
son of Louis XIV. and Madame de Montespan. The legend that
he was a supposititious child, really the son of an Italian police
constable named Chiapponi, is dealt with elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Maria
Stella</a></span>, countess of Newborough). The god-parents of the duke
of Valois, as he was entitled till 1785, were Louis XVI. and Queen
Marie Antoinette; his governess was the famous Madame de
Genlis, to whose influence he doubtless owed many of the qualities
which later distinguished him: his wide, if superficial knowledge,
his orderliness, and perhaps his parsimony. Known since 1785
as the duc de Chartres, he was sixteen at the outbreak of the
Revolution, into which&mdash;like his father&mdash;he threw himself with
ardour. In 1790 he joined the Jacobin Club, in which the
moderate elements still predominated, and was assiduous in
attendance at the debates of the National Assembly. He thus
became a <i>persona grata</i> with the party in power; he was already
a colonel of dragoons, and in 1792 he was given a command in
the army of the North. As a lieutenant-general, at the age
of eighteen, he was present at the cannonade of Valmy (Sept.
20) and played a conspicuous part in the victory of Jemappes
(Nov. 6).</p>

<p>The republic had meanwhile been proclaimed, and the duc
de Chartres, who like his father had taken the name of <i>Egalité</i>,
posed as its zealous adherent. Fortunately for him, he was too
young to be elected deputy to the Convention, and while his
father was voting for the death of Louis XVI. he was serving
under Dumouriez in Holland. He shared in the disastrous day
of Neerwinden (March 18, 1793); was an accomplice of Dumouriez
in the plot to march on Paris and overthrow the republic, and
on the 5th of April escaped with him from the enraged soldiers
into the Austrian lines. He was destined not to return to France
for twenty years. He went first, with his sister Madame Adelaide,
to Switzerland where he obtained a situation for a few months
as professor in the college of Reichenau under an assumed name,<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
mainly in order to escape from the fury of the <i>émigrés</i>. The
execution of his father in November 1793 had made him duke
of Orleans, and he now became the centre of the intrigues of the
Orleanist party. In 1795 he was at Hamburg with Dumouriez,
who still hoped to make him king. With characteristic caution
Louis Philippe refused to commit himself by any overt pretensions,
and announced his intention of going to America; but
in the hope that something might happen in France to his
advantage, he postponed his departure, travelling instead
through the Scandinavian countries as far north as Lapland.
But in 1796, the Directory having offered to release his mother
and his two brothers, who had been kept in prison since the Terror,
on condition that he went to America, he set sail for the United
States, and in October settled in Philadelphia, where in February
1797 he was joined by his brothers the duc de Montpensier and
the comte de Beaujolais. Two years were spent by them in
travels in New England, the region of the Great Lakes, and of the
Mississippi; then the news of the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of 18 Brumaire
decided them to return to Europe. They returned in 1800, only
to find Napoleon Bonaparte&rsquo;s power firmly established. Immediately
on his arrival, in February 1800, the duke of Orleans,
at the suggestion of Dumouriez, sought an interview with the
comte d&rsquo;Artois, through whose instrumentality he was reconciled
with the exiled king Louis XVIII., who bestowed upon his brothers
the order of the Saint Esprit. The duke, however, refused to
join the army of Condé and to fight against France, an attitude
in which he persisted throughout, while maintaining his loyalty
to the king.<a name="fa2p" id="fa2p" href="#ft2p"><span class="sp">2</span></a> He settled with his brothers at Twickenham, near
London, where he lived till 1807&mdash;for the most part in studious
retirement.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May 1807 the duc de Montpensier died at
Christchurch in Hampshire, where he had been taken for change
of air, of consumption. The comte de Beaujolais was ill of the
same disease and in 1808 the duke took him to Malta, where he
died on the 29th of May. The duke now, in response to an
invitation from King Ferdinand IV., visited Palermo where,
on the 25th of November 1809 he married Princess Maria
Amelia, the king&rsquo;s daughter. He remained in Sicily until the
news of Napoleon&rsquo;s abdication recalled him to France. He was
cordially received by Louis XVIII.; his military rank was
confirmed, he was named colonel-general of hussars, and such
of the vast Orleans estates as had not been sold were restored
to him by royal ordinance. The object may have been, as
M. Debidour suggests, to compromise him with the revolutionary
parties and to bind him to the throne; but it is more probable
that it was no more than an expression of the good will which
the king had shown him ever since 1800. The immediate effect
was to make him enormously rich, his wealth being increased
by his natural aptitude for business until, after the death of his
mother in 1821, his fortune was reckoned at some £8,000,000.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the heated atmosphere of the reaction, his
sympathy with the Liberal opposition brought him again under
suspicion. His attitude in the House of Peers in the autumn
of 1815 cost him a two years&rsquo; exile to Twickenham; he courted
popularity by having his children educated <i>en bourgeois</i> at the
public schools; and the Palais Royal became the rendezvous
of all the leaders of that middle-class opinion by which he was
ultimately to be raised to the throne.</p>

<p>His opportunity came with the revolution of 1830. During
the three &ldquo;July days&rdquo; the duke kept himself discreetly in the
background, retiring first to Neuilly, then to Raincy. Meanwhile,
Thiers issued a proclamation pointing out that a Republic would
embroil France with all Europe, while the duke of Orleans,
who was &ldquo;a prince devoted to the principles of the Revolution&rdquo;
and had &ldquo;carried the tricolour under fire&rdquo; would be a &ldquo;citizen
king&rdquo; such as the country desired. This view was that of the
rump of the chamber still sitting at the Palais Bourbon, and
a deputation headed by Thiers and Laffitte waited upon the
duke to invite him to place himself at the head of affairs. He
returned with them to Paris on the 30th, and was elected by the
deputies lieutenant-general of the realm. The next day, wrapped
in a tricolour scarf and preceded by a drummer, he went on foot
to the Hôtel de Ville&mdash;the headquarters of the republican party&mdash;where
he was publicly embraced by Lafayette as a symbol that
the republicans acknowledged the impossibility of realizing
their own ideals and were prepared to accept a monarchy based
on the popular will. Hitherto, in letters to Charles X., he had
protested the loyalty of his intentions,<a name="fa3p" id="fa3p" href="#ft3p"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and the king now nominated
him lieutenant-general and then, abdicating in favour of
his grandson the comte de Chambord appointed him regent.
On the 7th of August, however, the Chamber by a large majority
declared Charles X. deposed, and proclaimed Louis Philippe
&ldquo;King of the French, by the grace of God and the will of the
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The career of Louis Philippe as King of the French is dealt
with elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: <i>History</i>). Here it must suffice
to note something of his personal attitude towards affairs and
the general effects which this produced. For the trappings
of authority he cared little. To conciliate the revolutionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
passion for equality he was content to veil his kingship for a
while under a middle-class disguise. He erased the royal lilies
from the panels of his carriages; and the Palais Royal, like the
White House at Washington, stood open to all and sundry who
cared to come and shake hands with the head of the state. This
pose served to keep the democrats of the capital in a good
temper, and so leave him free to consolidate the somewhat
unstable foundation of his throne and to persuade his European
fellow-sovereigns to acknowledge in him not a revolutionary
but a conservative force. But when once his position at home
and abroad had been established, it became increasingly clear
that he possessed all the Bourbon tenaciousness of personal
power. When a &ldquo;party of Resistance&rdquo; came into office with
Casimir-Périer in March 1831, the speech from the throne
proclaimed that &ldquo;France has desired that the monarchy should
become national, it does not desire that it should be powerless&rdquo;;
and the migration of the royal family to the Tuileries symbolized
the right of the king not only to reign but to rule. Republican
and Socialist agitation, culminating in a series of dangerous
risings, strengthened the position of the king as defender of
middle-class interest; and since the middle classes constituted
the <i>pays légal</i> which alone was represented in Parliament, he
came to regard his position as unassailable, especially after the
suppression of the risings under Blanqui and Barbès in 1839.
Little by little his policy, always supported by a majority in
a house of representatives elected by a corrupt and narrow
franchise, became more reactionary and purely dynastic. His
position in France seeming to be unassailable, he sought to
strengthen it in Europe by family alliances. The fact that his
daughter Louise was the consort of Leopold I., king of the
Belgians, had brought him into intimate and cordial relations
with the English court, which did much to cement the <i>entente
cordiale</i> with Great Britain. Broken in 1840 during the affair
of Mehemet Ali (<i>q.v.</i>) the entente was patched up in 1841 by
the Straits Convention and re-cemented by visits paid by
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to the Château d&rsquo;Eu in 1843
and 1845 and of Louis Philippe to Windsor in 1844, only to be
irretrievably wrecked by the affair of the &ldquo;Spanish marriages,&rdquo;
a deliberate attempt to revive the traditional Bourbon policy
of French predominance in Spain. If in this matter Louis
Philippe had seemed to sacrifice the international position of
France to dynastic interests, his attempt to re-establish it by
allying himself with the reactionary monarchies against the
Liberals of Switzerland finally alienated from him the French
Liberal opinion on which his authority was based. When, in
February 1848, Paris rose against him, he found that he was
practically isolated in France.</p>

<p>Charles X., after abdicating, had made a dignified exit from
France, marching to the coast surrounded by the cavalry,
infantry and artillery of his Guard. Louis Philippe was less
happily situated. Escaping with the queen from the Tuileries
by a back entrance, he made his way with her in disguise to
Honfleur, where the royal couple found refuge in a gardener&rsquo;s
cottage. They were ultimately smuggled out of the country
by the British consul at Havre as Mr and Mrs Smith,<a name="fa4p" id="fa4p" href="#ft4p"><span class="sp">4</span></a> arriving
at Newhaven &ldquo;unprovided with anything but the clothes they
wore.&rdquo; They settled at Claremont, placed at their disposal by
Queen Victoria, under the <i>incognito</i> of count and countess of
Neuilly. Here on the 26th of August 1850, Louis Philippe died.</p>

<p>The character of Louis Philippe is admirably traced by Queen
Victoria in a memorandum of May 2, 1855, in which she compares
him with Napoleon III. She speaks of his &ldquo;vast knowledge
upon all and every subject,&rdquo; and &ldquo;his great activity of
mind.&rdquo; He was, unlike Napoleon, &ldquo;<i>thoroughly French</i> in character,
possessing all the liveliness and talkativeness of that
people.&rdquo; But she also speaks of the &ldquo;tricks and over-reachings&rdquo;
practised by him, &ldquo;who in great as well as in small things took a
pleasure in being cleverer and more cunning than others, often
when there was no advantage to be gained by it, and which was,
unfortunately, strikingly displayed in the transactions connected
with the Spanish marriages, which led to the king&rsquo;s downfall,
and ruined him in the eyes of all Europe&rdquo; (<i>Letters</i>, pop. ed.,
iii. 122).</p>

<p>Louis Philippe had eight children. His eldest son, the popular
Ferdinand Philippe, duke of Orleans (b. 1810), who had married
Princess Helena of Mecklenburg, was killed in a carriage accident
on the 13th of July 1842, leaving two sons, the comte de Paris
and the duc de Chartres. The other children were Louise,
consort of Leopold I., king of the Belgians; Marie, who married
Prince Alexander of Württemberg and died in 1839; Louis
Charles, duc de Nemours; Clementine, married to the duke of
Coburg-Kohary; François Ferdinand, prince de Joinville;
Henri Eugène, duc d&rsquo;Aumale (<i>q.v.</i>); Antoine Philippe, duc de
Montpensier, who married the Infanta, younger sister of Queen
Isabella of Spain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUISE<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie Luise</span>] (1776-1810),
queen of Prussia, was born on the 10th of March 1776 in Hanover,
where her father, Prince Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, was
field-marshal of the household brigade. Her mother was a
princess of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1793 Louise met at Frankfort
the crown prince of Prussia, afterwards King Frederick William
III., who was so fascinated by her beauty, and by the nobleness
of her character, that he asked her to become his wife. They
were married on the 24th of December of the same year. As
queen of Prussia she commanded universal respect and affection,
and nothing in Prussian history is more pathetic than the dignity
and unflinching courage with which she bore the sufferings
inflicted on her and her family during the war between Prussia
and France. After the battle of Jena she went with her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
to Königsberg, and when the battles of Eylau and Friedland
had placed Prussia absolutely at the mercy of France, she made
a personal appeal to Napoleon at his headquarters in Tilsit, but
without success. Early in 1808 she accompanied the king from
Memel to Königsberg, whence, towards the end of the year, she
visited St Petersburg, returning to Berlin on the 23rd of December
1809. During the war Napoleon attempted to destroy the queen&rsquo;s
reputation, but the only effect of his charges in Prussia was to
make her more deeply beloved. On the 19th of July 1810 she
died in her husband&rsquo;s arms, while visiting her father in Strelitz.
She was buried in the garden of the palace at Charlottenburg,
where a mausoleum, containing a fine recumbent statue by
Rauch, was built over her grave. In 1840 her husband was
buried by her side. The Louise Foundation (Luisenstift) for the
education of girls was established in her honour, and in 1814
Frederick William III. instituted the Order of Louise (Luisenorden).
In 1880 a statue of Queen Louise was erected in the
Thiergarten at Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUISE OF SAVOY<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (1476-1531), duchess of Angoulême,
mother of Francis I. of France, was daughter of a cadet of the
house of Savoy, Philip, count of Bresse, afterwards duke of
Savoy. Through her mother, Marguerite de Bourbon, she was
niece of Pierre de Bourbon, sire de Beaujeu, afterwards duke of
Bourbon. At the age of twelve she was married to Charles of
Valois, count of Angoulême, great-grandson of King Charles V.
The count died in 1496, leaving her the mother of two children,
Marguerite (b. 1492) and Francis (b. 1494). The accession of
Louis XII., who was childless, made Francis of Angoulême the
heir-presumptive to the throne of France. Louise brought her
children to the court, and received Amboise as her residence.
She lived henceforth in fear lest Louis should have a son; and
in consequence there was a secret rivalry between her and the
queen, Anne of Brittany. Finally, her son became king on the
1st of January 1515 by the death of Louis XII. From him
Louise received the county of Angoulême, which was erected
into a duchy, the duchy of Anjou, and the counties of Maine
and Beaufort. She was then given the title of &ldquo;Madame.&rdquo;
From 1515 to her death, she took the chief share in the government.
The part she played has been variously judged, and is
not yet completely elucidated. It is certain that Louise had a
clear head, practical good sense and tenacity. In the critical
situation after the battle of Pavia (1525) she proved herself
equal to the emergency, maintained order in the kingdom, and
man&oelig;uvred very skilfully to detach Henry VIII. of England
from the imperial alliance. But she appears to have been passionate,
exceedingly rapacious and ever careful of her own
interest. In her malignant disputes with the constable de
Bourbon on the question of his wife&rsquo;s succession, she goaded
him to extreme measures, and her rapacity showed itself also
in her dealings with the <i>surintendant des finances</i>, J. de Beaune,
baron de Samblançay (d. 1527), who diverted the money intended
for the French soldiers in Italy into the coffers of the queen,
and suffered death in consequence. She died in 1531, and
Francis reunited to the crown her domains, which comprised
the Bourbonnais, Beaujolais, Auvergne, la Marche, Angoumois,
Maine and Anjou.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUISIANA,<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> one of the Southern States of the United States
of America, lying on the N. coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Beginning
on the N., its boundary follows eastward the parallel of 33°
N., separating Louisiana from Arkansas; then descends the
Mississippi river, separating it from the state of Mississippi,
southward to 31°; passes eastward on this parallel to the Pearl
river, still with the state of Mississippi on the E.; and descends
this river to the Gulf. On the W. the Sabine river, from the
Gulf to 32° N., and, thence to the parallel of 33°, a line a little W.
of (and parallel to) the meridian of 94° W., separate Louisiana
from Texas. Including islands in the Gulf, the stretch of
latitude is approximately 4° and of longitude 5°. The total area
is 48,506 sq. m., of which 3097 sq. m. are water surface (including
1060 sq. m. of landlocked coastal bays called &ldquo;lakes&rdquo;). The
coast line is about 1500 m.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;Geologically Louisiana is a very recent
creation, and belongs to the &ldquo;Coastal Plain Province.&rdquo; Most of
the rocks or soils composing its surface were formed as submarine
deposits; the easternmost and southernmost parts are true river
deposits. These facts are the key to the state&rsquo;s chorography. The
average elevation of the state above the sea is only about 75 ft.,
and practically the only parts more than 400 ft. high are hills in
Sabine, Claiborne and Vernon parishes. The physiographic features
are few and very simple. The essential elements are five<a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a>: diluvial
plains, coast marshes, prairies, &ldquo;bluffs&rdquo; and &ldquo;pine-hills&rdquo; (to use
the local nomenclature). These were successive stages in the geologic
process which has created, and is still actively modifying, the
state. They are all seen, spread from N. to S., west of the Mississippi,
and also, save only the prairies, in the so-called &ldquo;Florida parishes&rdquo;
E. of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>These different elements in the region W. of the Mississippi are
arranged from N. to S. in the order of decreasing geologic age and
maturity. Beginning with elevations of about 400 ft. near the
Arkansas line, there is a gentle slope toward the S.E. The northern
part can best be regarded as a low plateau (once marine sediments)
sloping southward, traversed by the large diluvial valleys of the
Mississippi, Red and Ouachita rivers, and recut by smaller tributaries
into smaller plateaus and rather uniform flat-topped hills. The
&ldquo;bluffs&rdquo; (remnants of an eroded plain formed of alluvion deposits
over an old, mature and drowned topography) run through the
second tier of parishes W. of the Mississippi above the Red river.
Below this river prairie areas become increasingly common, constituting
the entire S.W. corner of the state. They are usually only
20 to 30 ft. above the sea in this district, never above 70, and are
generally treeless except for marginal timber along the sluggish,
meandering streams. One of their peculiar features&mdash;the sandy
circular &ldquo;mounds,&rdquo; 2 to 10 ft. high and 20 to 30 or even 50 ft. in
diameter, sometimes surmounted by trees in the midst of a treeless
plain and sometimes arranged in circles and on radii, and decreasing
in size with distance from the centre of the field&mdash;has been variously
explained. The mounds were probably formed by some gentle
eruptive action like that exhibited in the &ldquo;mud hills&rdquo; along the
Mississippi below New Orleans; but no explanation is generally
accepted. The prairies shade off into the coast marshes. This
fringe of wooded swamp and sea marsh is generally 20 to 30, but in
places even 50 and 60 m. in width. Where the marsh is open and
grassy, flooded only at high tides or in rainy seasons, and the ground
firm enough to bear cattle, it is used as range. Considerable tracts
have also been diked and reclaimed for cotton, sugar and especially
for rice culture. The tidal action of the gulf is so slight and the
marshes are so low that perfect drainage cannot be obtained through
tide gates, which must therefore be supplemented by pumping
machinery when rains are heavy or landward winds long prevail.
Slight ridges along the streams and bayous which traverse it, and
occasional patches of slightly elevated prairie, relieve in a measure
the monotonous expanse. It is in and along the borders of this
coast swamp region that most of the rice and much of the sugar cane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
of the state are grown. Long bar-like &ldquo;islands&rdquo; (conspicuous high
land rising above the marsh and prairie)&mdash;Orange, Petite Anse,
Grand Cote, Cote Blanche and Belle Isle&mdash;offer very interesting
topographical and geological problems. &ldquo;Trembling prairies&rdquo;&mdash;land
that trembles under the tread of men or cattle&mdash;are common
near the coast. Most of the swamp fringe is reclaimable. The
marshes encroach most upon the parishes of St Charles, Orleans and
Plaquemines. In St Charles the cultivable strip of land along the
river is only about 3 m. wide. In Orleans the city of New Orleans
occupies nearly all the high ground and encroaches on the swamps.
In Plaquemines there is practically no cultivable land below Forts
Jackson and St Philip, and above there is only a narrow strip.</p>

<p>The alluvial lands include the river flood plains. The principal
rivers are the Mississippi, which flows nearly 600 m. through and
along the border of the state, the Red river, the Ouachita (or Washita),
Sabine and Pearl; all except the last are navigable at all stages of
the water. There are many &ldquo;bayous,&rdquo; several of which are of great
importance, both for navigation and for drainage. They may be
characterized as secondary outlets of the rivers or flood distributaries.
Among them are Bayou Teche, Bayou Plaquemine, Atchafalaya
Bayou,<a name="fa2q" id="fa2q" href="#ft2q"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Bayou Lafourche and Bayou B&oelig;uf. Almost all secondary
water-courses, particularly if they have sluggish currents, are known
as bayous. Some might well be called lakes, and others rivers. The
alluvial portion of the state, especially below the mouth of the Red
river, is an intricate network of these bayous, which, before their
closure by a levee system, served partially, in time of flood, to carry
off the escaping surplus of river waters. They are comparatively inactive
at all seasons; indeed, the action of the tides and back-waters
and the tangle of vegetation in the sombre swamps and forests
through which they run, often render their currents almost imperceptible
at ordinary water. Navigable waters are said to penetrate
all but four of the parishes of the state, their total length
approximating 3800 m.</p>

<p>Each of the larger streams, as well as a large proportion of the
smaller ones, is accompanied by a belt of bottom land, of greater or
less width, lying low as regards the stream, and liable to overflow
at times of high water. These flood plains form collectively what
is known as the alluvial region, which extends in a broad belt down
the Mississippi, from the mouth of the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico,
and up the Ouachita and its branches and the Red river to and
beyond the limits of the state. Its breadth along the Mississippi
within Louisiana ranges from 10 to 50 or 60 m., and that along the
Red river and the Ouachita has an average breadth of 10 m. Through
its great flood-plain the Mississippi river winds upon the summit of
a ridge formed by its own deposits. In each direction the country
falls away in a succession of minor undulations, the summits of the
ridges being occupied by the streams and bayous. Nearly all of
this vast flood-plain lies below the level of high water in the Mississippi,
and, but for the protection afforded by the levees, every considerable
rise of its waters would inundate vast areas of fertile and
cultivated land. The low regions of Louisiana, including the alluvial
lands and the coast swamps, comprise about 20,000 sq. m., or nearly
one-half the area of the state. The remainder consists of the uplands
of prairie and forest.</p>

<p>The alluvial region of the state in 1909 was mainly protected
against overflow from the Mississippi river by 754 m. of levee on the
Mississippi river within the state, and 84 m. on the Mississippi river,
Cypress and Amos Bayou in Arkansas, forming part of the general
system which extends through other states, 1000 m. up to the
highlands about the junction of the Ohio river. The state and the
national government co-operate in the construction and maintenance
of this system, but the Federal government did not give material aid
(the only exception being the grant of swamp lands in 1850) until the
exceptionally disastrous flood in 1882. For about a century and a
half before that time, levee building had been undertaken in a more
or less spasmodic and tentative way, first by riparian proprietors,
then by local combinations of public and private interests, and
finally by the state, acting through levee districts, advised by a
Board of Engineers. The Federal government, after its participation
in the work, acted through a Board of Engineers, known as the
&ldquo;Mississippi River Commission.&rdquo; The system of 754 m. of Mississippi
river levees, within the state, was built almost entirely after
1866, and represents an expenditure of about $43,000,000 for
primary construction alone; of this sum, the national government
contributed probably a third (the state expended about $24,000,000
on levees before the Civil War). Some of the levees, especially those
in swampy regions where outlet bayous are closed, are of extraordinary
solidity and dimensions, being 20 to 40 ft. high, or even
more, across streams or bayous&mdash;formerly outlets&mdash;with bases of
8 or 10 ft. to one of height. The task of maintenance consists almost
entirely in closing the gaps which occur when the banks on which
the levees are built cave into the river. Levee systems on some of
the interior or tributary rivers, aggregating some 602 m., are exclusively
built and maintained by the state. Louisiana also contributes
largely to the 84 m. of levee in Arkansas, necessary to its
security from overflow. The improvement of bayous, channels, the
construction of canals and the drainage of swamp lands also contribute
to the protection of the state.</p>

<p>The lakes are mainly in three classes. First come the coast
lagoons, many of which are merely landlocked salt-water bays,
the waters of which rise and fall with the tides. Of this class are
Pontchartrain, Borgne, Maurepas and Sabine. These are simply
parts of the sea which have escaped the filling-in process carried on
by the great river and the lesser streams. A second class, called
&ldquo;ox-bow&rdquo; lakes, large in numbers but small in area, includes
ordinary cut-off meanders along the Mississippi and Red rivers. A
third class, those upon the Red river and its branches, are caused
mainly by the partial stoppage of the water above Shreveport by
the &ldquo;raft,&rdquo; a mass of drift such as frequently gathers in western
rivers, which for a distance of 45 m. almost completely closed the
channel until it was broken up by government engineers. These
lakes are much larger at flood season than at other times, and have
been much reduced in size by the cutting of a channel through the
raft. Lakes of this class are sometimes formed by the choking of
the mouth of feeble tributaries by silt deposited by the Red river
where the currents meet.</p>

<p><i>Mineral Resources.</i>&mdash;Mineral resources are few, but important.
In the Tertiary region are found small quantities of iron ore and an
indifferent brown coal. The important mineral products are salt,
sulphur, petroleum and natural gas. The deposit of rock salt on
Petite Anse Island, in the coast swamp region, has been extensively
worked since its discovery during the Civil War. The deposit is in
places 1000 ft. thick, and yields salt of extraordinary purity (sometimes
99% pure). There are large deposits also on Orange Island
(in places at least 1800 ft. thick), on Week&rsquo;s Island, on Belle Isle
and probably beneath the intervening marshes. In 1907 Louisiana
ranked sixth among the salt-producing states of the country (after
New York, Michigan, Ohio, Kansas and California), its output being
valued at $226,892, only a few hundred dollars more than that of
Texas. Near Lake Charles, at Sulphur, are very extraordinary
sulphur deposits. The beds lie several (for the most part four to six)
hundred feet underground and are of disputed origin. Many regard
them as products of an extinct volcano; according to others they
are of vegetable origin (they are found in conjunction with gypsum).
They were discovered before 1870 by searchers after petroleum,
but their exploitation remained in the experimental stage until about
1900. The sulphur is dissolved by superheated water forced down
pipes, and the water with sulphur in solution is forced upward by
hot air pressure through other pipes; the sulphur comes, 99% pure,
to the surface of the ground, where it is cooled in immense bins,
and then broken up and loaded directly upon cars for shipment.
These mines divide with the Sicilian mines the control of the sulphur
market of the world. The value of the sulphur taken from the mines
of Louisiana in 1907 was a little more than $5,000,000. Evidences
of petroleum were discovered long ago, in the very field where in
recent years the Beaumont and Vinton wells were bored. In 1909
Jennings was the chief field in Louisiana, lesser fields being at
Welsh, Anse la Butte, Caddo and Vinton. The Jennings field, one
of the greatest in the United States, produced up to and including
1907 more than 26,000,000 barrels of high-grade oil, twelve-thirteenths
of which came from an area of only 50 acres, one well producing
a tenth of the entire output. In 1907 the state produced
5,000,221 barrels of petroleum, valued at $4,063,033. Natural gas
is found in Caddo parish, about 20 m. N. of Shreveport. The
depth of the wells is from 840 to 2150 ft.; two wells completed in
1907 had a daily capacity estimated at 35,000,000 to 50,000,000 ft.
Shreveport, Oil City, Blanchard, Mooringsport, Bossier City and
Texarkana are supplied with natural gas by pipe lines from this field.
Kaolin is found in the state; in 1907 the total value of all clay
products was $928,579.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate is semi-tropical and exceptionally equable
over large areas. In the S. and S.E. the equable temperature is
largely the effect of the network of bays, bayous and lakes, and
throughout the state the climate is materially influenced by the prevailing
southerly winds from the Gulf of Mexico. Some daily variation
in the temperature of adjoining localities is caused by a dark
soil in the one and a light soil in the other, but the differences of mean
annual temperature are almost wholly due to differences of latitude
and elevation. The mean annual temperature for a period of nineteen
years (Jan. 1888 to Dec. 1906) ranged from 70° F. at Port Eads, in
the extreme S.E., to 65° F. at Lake Providence, in the N.E. The
mean temperature of July, the hottest month, is comparatively
uniform over the state, varying only from 81° to 83°; the mean for
January, the coldest month, varies from 46° in the extreme north
to 56° in the extreme south. Even in the coldest localities eight or
nine months are wholly free from frost, and in the coast parishes
frost occurs only a few days in each year. Rainfall is usually heavy
in the S.E., but it decreases toward the N.W. As much as 85.6 in.
have fallen within a year at New Orleans, but in this locality the
average for a year is about 57.6 in.; at Shreveport the average is
46 in., and for the entire state it is 55 in. Much more rain falls in
summer than in any other season, but in some parts the heaviest
rainfall is in the spring and in others in the winter. A light fall of
snow is not uncommon in the northern parishes, but in the southern
part of the state snow falls not oftener than once in three to five
years. Hailstorms are infrequent everywhere, but especially so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
in the south. Only a fourth to a half of the days of the different
months are wholly or partly clear even in the north, and in the same
district the monthly means of relative humidity vary from 65 to 70.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;The entire state is included within the Austro-riparian
life zone; the higher portions fall within the Carolinian area and the
lower portions, including the Gulf and the Mississippi embayment
almost to the N.E. corner of the state, constitute a special semi-tropical
region. The native fauna of the state resembles in its
general features that of the other Gulf states. The feral fauna was
once rather varied. Black bears, wolves and deer are not yet
extinct, and more rarely a &ldquo;wild cat&rdquo; (lynx) or &ldquo;panther&rdquo; (puma)
is seen in the swamps. Of smaller mammals, raccoons, squirrels and
opossums are very common. Every bayou contains alligators;
and reptiles of various species, such as turtles, lizards, horned toads,
rattlesnakes and moccasins are abundant. Shrimps, frogs (of great
commercial importance), terrapin, clams and oysters are common.
Only in very recent years have oysters, though plentiful, become of
competitive importance in the national market; they are greatly
favoured by state protective legislation. In 1904 a state oyster
commission was created to supplant the independent control by the
parishes. An important boundary dispute with Mississippi arose
over beds lying near the state line. The state leases the beds at a
low annual rental in tracts (limited for each person, firm or corporation
to 1000 acres), and draws from them a considerable revenue.
The avifauna is varied and abundant, comprising eagles, vultures
(protected by law), hawks, owls, pelicans, cranes, turkeys, geese,
&ldquo;partridges&rdquo; (called quail or &ldquo;Bob White&rdquo; elsewhere), ducks, &amp;c.,
besides numerous smaller species, many of which are brilliant of
plumage but harsh of voice.</p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;Heavy rainfall, high temperature and fertile soil combine
to cover the greater part of the state, and particularly the alluvial
regions and the coast swamps, with a most luxuriant subtropical
vegetation, both arborescent and herbaceous. Louisiana is justly
celebrated for the beauty and fragrance of its flowers. The range of
temperature is not sufficient to give the variety of annual wild flowers
of more northern climates; nevertheless flowers cover the bottom
lands and uplands in great profusion. The upland flora is the more
diversified. Flowering annuals are mainly aquatic. Water lilies,
water hyacinths, which are an obstruction in many streams, and
irises in rich variety give colour to the coast wastes and sombre
bayous. Notable among the flora are roses, japonicas, hibiscus
shrubs of various species, poinsettias, tea olives, crepe myrtle,
jasmines, magnolias, camellias, oleanders, chrysanthemums, geraniums
and plumbagos. The value and variety of the timber are
very great. Much of the river swamp region is covered with cypress
trees festooned with Spanish moss. The most common species in
the alluvial regions and, to a less degree, in the drier portions of the
swamps and in the stream bottoms of the prairies are various oaks,
black, sweet and tupelo gum, holly, cotton-wood, poplar, magnolia
sweet bay, the tulip tree, catalpa, black walnut, pecans, hickories,
ash, beech and short-leaf pine. On drier and higher soils are the
persimmon, sassafras, red maple, elm, black haw, hawthorn, various
oaks (in all 10 species occur), hickories and splendid forests of long-leaf
and loblolly yellow pine.</p>

<p><i>Forestry.</i>&mdash;These forests are the greatest and finest of their kind
remaining in the United States. In 1898 it was estimated by Henry
Gannett (followed by the Federal census of 1900) that the timbered
area covered 28,300 sq. m. Professor C. S. Sargent estimated in
1884 that the stand of short-leaf and long-leaf pines aggregated
respectively 21,625 and 26,558 million feet. The timber product
of 1900 ($17,294,444) was almost ten times that of 1880 ($1,764,640);
and in 1905 the product value ($35,192,374) was more than twice
that of 1900. Nevertheless, in 1900 the cypress forests remained
practically untouched, only slight impression had been made upon
the pine areas, and the hard-wood forests, except that they had been
culled of their choicest oak, remained in their primal state (U.S.
census). Between 1900 and 1905 furniture factories and planing
mills became somewhat important. Pond pine occurs only near the
Pearl river. Curly pine is fairly abundant. The eastern pine belt is
composed of the long-leaf pine, interspersed with some loblolly. It
covers an area of about 3900 sq. m. The south-western pine belt
contains the heaviest growth of long-leaf pine timber in the world,
covering an area of about 4200 sq. m., and occasionally interspersed
with short-leaf pine. The short-leaf growth is especially heavy in
the north-western portion of the state, while the long-leaf is found
mainly in large masses N. and S. of the Red river around Alexandria
as a centre. The cypress forests of the alluvial and overflowed
lands in the S. of the state are among the largest and the most
heavily timbered known. The hard-woods are found in the river
bottoms throughout the state.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Agriculture and Soils.</i>&mdash;Agriculture is the chief industry of the
State. In 1900 26.2% of the land was in farms, and of this
area about two-fifths was improved. The size of the average
farm decreased in the two preceding decades from 171.3 to 95.4
acres. The percentage of farms operated by owners (<i>i.e.</i> owners,
part owners, owners and tenants, and managers) fell from 64.8
to 42.1% from 1880 to 1900, and the percentage operated by
cash tenants increased from 13.8 in 1880 to 24.9 in 1900, and by
share tenants from 21.5 in 1880 to 33.0 in 1900; the percentage
of farms operated by white farmers was 49.8 in 1900. The value
of farm property, $198,536,906 in 1900, increased 79.8% in the
preceding decade. The value of live stock in the latter year
was $28,869,506. The total value of all farm products in 1899
was $72,667,302, of which $59,276,092 was the value of the
distinctive crops&mdash;cotton, sugar and rice. The state bureau of
agriculture in 1903 estimated that of the total area 14.9 millions
of acres were timber land, 5.7 millions pasture and marsh, and
5.0 millions cultivated farm land.</p>

<p>In the N. there are many sandy districts in the uplands, also
sandy clays; in the &ldquo;second bottoms&rdquo; of the streams fertile
sandy loams; abundant tertiary marls in the north-central
region; some gypsum in the cretaceous &ldquo;islands&rdquo;; and some
fossiliferous marls with decomposed limestones. The prairies of
south-western Louisiana have much yellow marl underlying them.
Alluvial soil and bluff, the location of which has been indicated,
are of primary agricultural importance. Reclaimed marsh-land
and fresh alluvium (the so-called &ldquo;front-lands&rdquo; on rivers and
bayous) are choice soil for Indian corn, sugar-cane, perique
tobacco, semi-tropical fruits and cotton. The bluff lands are
simply old alluvium now well drained and above all floods.
The prairies of the S.W. are devoted almost exclusively to rice.
On the hills yellow-leaf tobacco can be grown. Cereals and
forage plants can be successfully grown everywhere, and varied
and profitable agriculture is possible even on the &ldquo;pine-barrens&rdquo;
or uplands of the N.; but more intelligent and more intensive
farming is necessary than that practised by the average &ldquo;piney-woods&rdquo;
farmer. The alluvial section of lower Louisiana is
mostly devoted to sugar, and farther northward to Indian corn
and cotton.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Cotton is the principal crop. In 1907 Louisiana ranked eighth in
acreage of cotton (1,622,000 acres) among the states of the United
States, and in 1907-1908 the cotton crop (675,428 bales) was eighth
among the crops of the states. The average yield per acre varies
from about .45 to .75 bale according to the season. In good seasons
and exceptional localities the yield may approach a bale per acre,
as in Assumption parish, and in the Mississippi valley at the junction
of Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas. For many years there has
been a reaction against the all-cotton farming system. In general,
the small cotton farmer was at the mercy of the commission merchant,
to whom he mortgaged his crops in advance; but this evil has
lessened, and in some districts the system of advancing is either non-existent
or very slightly developed.</p>

<p>In 1907-1908 all the sugar produced from cane grown in the United
States came from Louisiana (335,000 long tons) and Texas (12,000
tons); in the same year cane sugar from Hawaii amounted to
420,000 tons, from Porto Rico to 217,000 tons and from the Philippines
to 135,000 tons; and the total yield of beet sugar from the
United States was 413,954 tons. Of all the cane grown, an amount
between one-sixth and one-quarter&mdash;and that the best&mdash;must be
reserved for seed every other year, and this is a great handicap to
the state in competing with other cane regions and with the sugar
beet. Of the total sugar consumption of the country in 1899-1904
Louisiana produced somewhat more than a fifteenth. Since about
1880 there have been central factories, and their increase has been a
very prominent factor in the development of the industry, as it has
been in Cuba. Though very much of the region S. of the Red river
is fairly well suited to sugar-growing, it is still true that sugar cannot,
over much of this area, be grown to so great advantage as other
crops. Its hold upon the delta region is, however, almost unchallenged,
especially since the rice farmers have found in the prairie
lands that excel the delta for their purposes. Sugar is grown also
in St Landry and the eastern part of Attakapas&mdash;a name formerly
loosely applied to what are now St Mary, Iberia, Vermilion, St
Martin and Lafayette parishes. Though introduced with success
from Santo Domingo about the middle of the 18th century, the sugar
industry practically dates from 1796, when Étienne Boré first succeeded
in crystallizing and clarifying the syrup. Steam motive
power was first introduced on the plantations in 1822. The average
product of the ten seasons 1894-1904 was 299,745 tons. A state
sugar experiment station is maintained at Audubon Park in New
Orleans, its work embracing the development of seedlings, the
improvement of cane varieties, the study of fungus diseases of the
cane, the improvement of mill methods and the reconciliation of
such methods (for example, the use of sulphur as a bleaching and
clarifying agent) with the requirements of &ldquo;pure food&rdquo; laws.
Good work has also been done by the Audubon sugar school of the
state university, founded &ldquo;for the highest scientific training in the
growing of sugar cane and in the technology of sugar manufacture.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span></p>

<p>Tobacco might be grown profitably over a large part of the state,
but in reality very little is grown. The strong, black perique of the
delta&mdash;cultivated very generally in the lower alluvial region before
the Civil War, but now almost exclusively in St James parish&mdash;is a
famous leaf, grown since early colonial times. Bright or yellow
plug and smoking leaf are grown on the pine uplands and pine
&ldquo;flats,&rdquo; and a small amount of cigar tobacco on the flats, prairies
and &ldquo;bluffs.&rdquo; The total value of the tobacco crop of 35,000 &#8468; in
1907 was only $10,000, an amount exceeded by each of the other
24 tobacco-growing states, and the crop was about one-twentieth
of 1% of the product of the whole United States.</p>

<p>Rice farming, which had its beginning immediately after the Civil
War and first became prominent in the &rsquo;seventies, has developed
enormously since 1880. From 1879 to 1899 the product increased
twenty-five fold. Formerly the grain was raised by preference in
the river bottoms, which still yield, almost invariably, the earliest
rice of the season and perhaps the finest. The &ldquo;buckshot clays&rdquo; of
the backlands, which are so stiff that they can scarcely be ploughed
until flooded and softened, and are remarkably retentive of moisture,
are ideal rice soil; but none of the alluvial lands has an underlying
hardpan, and they cannot as a rule be drained sufficiently to make
the use of heavy harvesting machinery possible. In 1880 the prairies
of the S.W. were opened to settlement by the railway. These prairies
are traversed by ridges, which facilitate irrigation, and are underlaid
by an impervious subsoil, which facilitates both effective storage
and drainage. Thus the use of machinery became possible, and this
revolutionized the entire industry. The year 1884 may be taken as
the initial date of the new period, and the grain is now harvested
exactly as is wheat in the west-central states. Previously the grain
had ordinarily been cut with sickles and harvested by hand. The
farms were also small, usually from 5 to 10 acres. They are now
very much larger. All the prairies district&mdash;the centre of which is
Crowley&mdash;is becoming one great rice field. Some rice also is grown
on the lowlands of the Mississippi valley, notably in Plaquemines,
Jefferson and Lafourche parishes. In the decade 1881-1890 Louisiana
produced about half of the total yield of the country, and from
1891 to 1900 about five-sevenths. In 1904 and 1906 the Louisiana
crop, about one-half of the total yield of the country, was larger
than that of any other state; but in 1905 and in 1907 (6,192,955 &#8468;
and 7,378,000 &#8468; respectively) the Louisiana crop was second in size
to that of Texas. Carolina and Honduras rices were practically
the only varieties until after 1896. Since that time select Japanese
species, chosen for superior milling qualities, have been widely introduced,
as the market prejudice in favour of head rice made the large
percentage of broken rice a heavy handicap to the farmers. Hundreds
of varieties have been tested by the state and federal agricultural
experiment stations. A strong tendency to run to red rice
(hardier, but not so marketable) has been a second great difficulty to
overcome.</p>

<p>Irrigation is almost entirely confined to rice farms. In the prairie
region there is abundant water at depths of 100 to 400 ft. beneath
the surface, but this was little used for irrigation for the first few
years of the development of this field, when water was pumped from
the streams and canals. In 1902 nearly one-eighth of the acreage
irrigated was by systems supplied from wells. The irrigated rice
area increased 92.9% from 1899 to 1902, and the construction cost
of irrigation works ($4,747,359 in 1902; $12.25 per irrigated acre)
87.7% in the same years. This increase was almost wholly in the
prairie parishes. Of the total irrigated area for rice of 387,580 acres
in 1902, 310,670 acres were in the parishes of Calcasieu, Acadia and
Vermilion. In the Mississippi valley water is taken from the river
by flumes in the levees or by siphons. The danger of floods and the
difficulty of drainage make the extension of the practice unprofitable,
and the opening of the prairies has made it unnecessary.</p>

<p>Many of the fruits of warm-temperate and semi-tropical lands,
whether native or exotic, including oranges, olives, figs, grape-fruit,
kumquats and pomegranates are cultivated. Oranges are grown
especially on the coast. There are many fine groves on the Mississippi
below New Orleans. The fig is a common door-yard tree as in other
Gulf and South Atlantic states, and is never killed down by frost.
Louisiana produced in 1899 only a fifth as great a value in sub-tropic
fruits as Arizona and Texas combined. Orchard fruits are
fairly varied, but, compared with other states, unimportant; and
the production of small fruits is comparatively small, the largest
crop being strawberries. Oranges and pears are seriously damaged
by insect and fungus pests. The total value of fruit products in
1899 was $412,933. Among nuts the native pecan is exceptionally
abundant, the product (637,470 &#8468; in 1899) being much greater than
that of any other state save Texas.</p>

<p>The total value of cereal products in 1899 was $14,491,796, including
Indian corn valued at $10,327,723 and rice valued at
$4,044,489; in 1907 it was more than $27,300,000, including Indian
corn valued at $19,600,000, rice valued at $7,378,000 and oats valued
at $223,000. Indian corn is grown only for home use. Dairying
interests are not largely developed, and in Texas and the adjoining
states the &ldquo;Texas fever&rdquo; and &ldquo;charbon&rdquo; have done great damage
to cattle. Forage crops are little grown, though soil conditions are
favourable. Cowpeas are a common fertilizer. Garden trucking
is very slightly developed, but has been successful where it has
been tried. The state maintains a crop pest commission, the
duties of which include the inspection of all nursery stock sold in
the state.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Manufactures</i>.&mdash;The state&rsquo;s manufacturing interests have
during the last few decades grown greatly in importance. From
1890 to 1900 the capital invested, the cost of materials used and
the value of output (in 1900, $121,181,683) increased respectively
225.4, 147.3 and 109.6%. The value of the factory products
in 1900 was $111,397,919; in 1905 it was $186,379,592. Slightly
above one-half of the product of 1900 was from New Orleans,
and in 1905 about 45.4%. A constitutional amendment of 1902
exempted from parochial and municipal taxes between 1900 and
1910 practically all factories and mines in the state, employing at
least five hands. Manufacturing industries are for the most
part closely related to the products of the soil, about two-thirds of
the value of all manufactures in 1900 and in 1905 being represented
by sugar and molasses refining, lumber and timber
products, cotton-seed oil and cake, and rice cleaned and polished.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Rice is milled at New Orleans, Crowley, Abbeville, Gayden,
Jennings and Lake Charles. Ramie fibre and jute are available for
coarse cloth; cotton weaving is almost non-existent. The lumber
industry is centred chiefly in Calcasieu parish. Lake Charles, Westlake,
Bogalusa, Bon Ami, Carson, Fisher, Fullerton, Leesville,
Oakdale and Pickering were the leading sawmill towns of the state
in 1908. Of the rarer woods particular mention may be made of
curly pine, yielding a wood of beautiful figure and polish; magnolia,
hard, close-grained, of fine polish and of great lasting qualities; and
cypress, light, strong, easily worked and never-rotting. The
timber cut of 1900 was officially stated as 1,214,387 M. ft. B.M., of
which two-thirds were of yellow pine and most of the remainder of
cypress. In some localities, especially in the &ldquo;Florida parishes,&rdquo;
small quantities of rosin and turpentine are taken from the long-leaf
pine, but this industry was unimportant in Louisiana before 1908.
Sawdust, slabs, stumps and large quantities of logs are wasted.
Other manufactures with a product value in 1905 of between
$4,000,000 and $1,000,000 were: bags (not paper); foundry and
machine-shop products; planing-mill products; railway cars,
construction and repairs; malt liquors; men&rsquo;s clothing; cooperage;
food preparations; roasted and ground coffee and spice; fertilizers;
cigars and cigarettes; cotton goods; and manufactured ice.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;The length of railway in the state was 1740 m. in
1890 and 4943.55 m. at the end of 1908. By the state constitution
of 1898 and by amendments of 1902 and 1904 tax exemptions for ten
years were granted to newly-built railroads completed before 1909.
The principal roads are the Missouri Pacific (St Louis, Iron Mountain
&amp; Southern, New Orleans &amp; North-western and St Louis, Watkins &amp;
Gulf), the Southern Pacific (Morgan&rsquo;s Louisiana &amp; Texas Railroad &amp;
Steamship Co. and the Louisiana Western), the Texas &amp; Pacific, the
Kansas City Southern, the Vicksburg, Shreveport &amp; Pacific, the
Louisiana Railway &amp; Navigation Co., the Yazoo &amp; Mississippi
Valley, the Illinois Central, and the Louisiana &amp; Arkansas. The
Illinois Central, the first railway giving Louisiana connexion with
the north, and of immense importance in the trade of New Orleans,
has only about 100 m. of double track in the state. The problem of
inland waterways has always been a most important one in northern,
eastern and southern Louisiana, where there are systems of improved
bayous, lakes and canals which, with the levees, make this region
something like Holland, on a greater scale. Many bayous are convertible
by improvement into excellent drainage and irrigation canals.
The canal system is especially well developed in the parishes of the
Mississippi delta, where, at the close of 1907, there were about 50 m.
of these waterways of decided commercial importance. They serve
the trade of Lake Pontchartrain and the Florida parishes, the
lumber, coal, fish, oyster and truck trade of New Orleans, and to
some extent are the highway of a miscellaneous coasting trade.
The most important canal is probably the new Atchafalaya Bay
canal (14 ft. deep), opened in 1907, connecting the Atchafalaya river
and Morgan City with the Gulf of Mexico. In 1907 active preliminary
work was begun on the Louisiana section of a great interstate
inland waterway projected by the national government between the
Mississippi and Rio Grande rivers, almost parallel to the Gulf Coast
and running through the rice and truck-farm districts from the
Teche to the Mermenton river (92 m.). The competition of the
water lines is felt by all the railways, and the importance of water
transportation is rapidly increasing. A state railroad commission,
organized in 1899, has power to regulate railway, steamer, sleeping-car,
express, telephone and telegraph rates within the state. Foreign
commerce is almost wholly centred at New Orleans.</p>

<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;The population of the state increased in the
ten decades from 1810 to 1910 successively by 100.4, 40.6,
63.4, 46.9, 36.7, 2.7, 29.3, 19.0, 23.5 and 19.9%. In 1910 it
was 1,656,388 (36.5 per sq. m.).<a name="fa3q" id="fa3q" href="#ft3q"><span class="sp">3</span></a> In 1900 47.1% was of negro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
blood, as compared with 51.5 in 1890. In 1910 there were nine
cities with more than 5000 inhabitants each: New Orleans (339,
075); Shreveport (28,015); Baton Rouge (14,897), the capital;
Lake Charles (11,449); Alexandria (11,213); Monroe (10,209);
New Iberia (7449); Morgan (5477); Crowley (5099). The urban
element is larger than in any other southern state, owing to the
large population of New Orleans. The Acadians (see § <i>History</i>
below) to-day are settled mainly in St Mary, Acadia and Vermilion
parishes; lesser numbers are in Avoyelles and St Landry;
and some are scattered in various other parishes. The parishes
of St Mary, Iberia, Vermilion, St Martin and Lafayette are known
as the Attakapas country from an Indian name. A colony of
Germans sent over by John Law to the Arkansas removed to the
Mississippi above New Orleans, and gave to its bank the name of
the &ldquo;German Coast,&rdquo; by which it is still known. In recent years
there has been an immigration of Italians into Louisiana, which
seems likely to prove of great social and economic importance.
The industrial activity of the state has required more labour than
has been available. The negroes have moved more and more from
the country to the towns, where they easily secure work at good
wages. Owing to the inadequate supply of labour two important
immigration leagues of business men were formed in 1904 and 1905,
and in 1907 the state government began officially to attempt
to secure desirable foreign immigration, sending agents abroad
to foster it. Roman Catholics greatly predominate among
religious denominations, having in 1906 477,774 members out
of a total of 778,901 for all denominations; in the same year
there were 185,554 Baptists, 79,464 Methodists, 9070 Protestant
Episcopalians and 8350 Presbyterians.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;Since the admission of the state to the Union
in 1812 there have been eight state constitutions (not counting
that of 1861) admirably illustrating&mdash;and not less the Territorial
government preceding them&mdash;the development of American
democracy and the problems connected with the negroes.
Under the Territorial government the legislative officers were not
at first elective. The &ldquo;parishes&rdquo; date from 1807; they were
based on an earlier Spanish division for religious purposes&mdash;whence
the names of saints in parish nomenclature. The constitution
of 1812 allowed the General Assembly to name the
governor from the two candidates receiving the highest number
of votes; gave the governor large powers of appointment,
even of local functionaries; and required a property qualification
for various offices, and even for voters. The constitution of
1845 made the popular suffrage final in the choice of the governor,
abolished property qualifications, and began to pare executive
powers for the benefit of the General Assembly or the people.
From it dates also the constitutional recognition of the public
schools. In 1852 even the judges of the supreme court were
placed among the officers chosen by popular vote. The constitutions
of 1864 and 1868 were of importance primarily as
bearing on negro status and national politics. That of 1879
showed a profound distrust of legislative action, bred of reconstruction
experiences. Nearly all special legislation was forbidden.
The last constitution (1898, with 26 amendments 1898-1906),
unlike all others after that of 1812, was not submitted to
the people for ratification.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Under this constitution sessions of the General Assembly are biennial
(meeting the second Monday in May in even-numbered years)
and are limited to sixty days. The number of senators is fixed by
the constitution at 39; the number of representatives is to be
not more than 116 or less than 98. Any elector is eligible for election
as a representative if he has been a citizen of the state for five years
and a resident of the district or parish from which he is elected for
two years immediately preceding the election; a change of residence
from the district or parish from which he was elected vacates the
seat of a representative or senator. A senator must be at least 25
years of age. Members of the legislature are elected for four years.
Revenue or appropriation bills originate in the House of Representatives,
but may be amended by the Senate. Contingent appropriations
are forbidden, and the constitution contains a long list
of subjects on which special laws may not be passed. The chief
executive officers have four-year terms, neither the governor nor the
treasurer being eligible for immediate re-election. The governor
must be at least 30 years old and must have been a citizen of the
United States and a resident of the state for 10 years next preceding
his election. Within five days after the passage of any bill by the
General Assembly he may veto this measure, which then becomes a
law only if passed by a two-thirds vote of all members elected to
each house of the General Assembly. The lieutenant governor (and
then the secretary of state) succeeds to the office of governor if the
governor is removed, dies or leaves the state. The five judges of
the supreme court of the state are elected by the people for
a term of twelve years. The supreme court is almost without
exception a court of appeal with jurisdiction in cases involving
at least $2000, in cases of divorce, in suits regarding adoption,
legitimacy and custody of children and as regards the legality and
constitutionality of taxes, fines, &amp;c. The supreme court appoints
courts of appeal to judge cases involving less than $2000. The
constitution prohibits lotteries and the sale of lottery tickets.</p>

<p>The suffrage clauses are of particular interest, as they accomplish
the practical disfranchisement of the negroes. The constitution
requires that a voter must (in addition to other qualifications) either
be able to show conclusively ability to read and write, or be the
owner of property within the state assessed at not less than $300,
on which, if personalty, all taxes are paid. But it excepts from
these requirements&mdash;thus letting down the bars for illiterate whites
excluded with negroes by the foregoing clauses&mdash;persons who were
entitled to vote in some state on or before the 1st of January 1867
(<i>i.e.</i> before the adoption of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
of the United States Constitution); also the sons or grandsons
of such voters, not under 21 years of age, on the 12th of May 1898;
and males of foreign birth who have resided in the state for five years
next preceding the date of application for registration and who
were naturalized prior to 1898. The constitution provides that no
person less than 60 years of age shall be permitted to vote unless he
has paid an annual poll-tax of one dollar for the two years next
preceding the year in which he offers to vote. Convicts not pardoned
with an explicit restoration of suffrage privileges are disfranchised&mdash;a
rare clause in the United States. Suffrage was by this constitution
first extended to women tax-payers in questions &ldquo;submitted to the
tax-payers, as such.&rdquo; The creation of a railroad commission was
ordered and the preparation of a code of criminal law.</p>

<p>The Louisiana Board of Levee Commissioners was organized in
1865. The state board of health was the first one effectively organized
(1855) in the United States. It encountered many difficulties,
and until the definite proof of the stegomyia hypothesis of yellow-fever
inoculation made by the United States army surgeons in Cuba
in 1900, the greatest problem seemed insoluble. Since that time
conditions of health in New Orleans have been revolutionized (in
1907 state control of maritime quarantine on the Mississippi was
supplanted by that of the national government), and smaller cities
and towns have been stimulated to take action by her example.
Sanitary institutes are held by the state board at various towns each
year for the instruction of the public. Boards of appraisers and
equalization oversee the administration of the tax system; the cost
of collection, owing to the fee system for payment of collectors,
was higher than in any other state of the Union until 1907, when the
fees were greatly reduced. The state assessment in 1901 totalled
$301,215,222 and in 1907 was $508,000,000. Schools and levees
absorb about half of all revenues, leaving half for the payment of
interest on the state debt (bonded debt on 1st of April 1908,
$11,108,300) and for expenses of government. A general primary
election law for the selection, by the voters, of candidates for state
office came into effect in 1906.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Law</i>.&mdash;Louisiana has been peculiar among the states of the
Union in the history of the development of its legal system.
In Louisiana alone (as the state is known to-day), out of all the
territory acquired from France as the Louisiana Purchase in
1803, was the civil law so established under French and Spanish
rule that it persisted under American dominion. In all the other
states formed from the Purchase, the civil law, never existent
practically, was early expressly abrogated, and the common law
of England established in its place. After O&rsquo;Reilly established
his power in 1769 (see <i>History</i>, below), the Spanish law was
supreme. All the old codes of the Peninsula, as well as the laws
of the Indies and special royal decrees and schedules, were in
force in the colony. The United States left the task of altering
the laws to the people, as far as there was no conflict between
them and the Constitution of the United States and fundamental
American legal customs. Copies of the Spanish codes were very
rare, and some of them could not be had in the colonies. Discussions
of the Roman Institute and Pandects were common in
the deliberations of the courts. Great confusion prevailed in the
first years of American dominion owing to the diversities of
languages and the grafting of such Anglo-Saxon institutions as
the jury upon the older system. A provisional code of judicial
procedure, prepared by Edward Livingston, was in effect in
1805 to 1825. The earliest digest, completed in 1808, was mainly
a compilation of Spanish laws. The project of the <i>Code Napoléon</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
however&mdash;the <i>code</i> itself not being available in Louisiana,
though promulgated in France in 1804&mdash;was used by the compilers
in the arrangement and substance of their work; and the
French traditions of the colony, thus illustrated, were naturally
introduced more and more into the organic commentaries and
developments that grew up around the <i>Code Napoléon</i>. This
evolution was little marked, so similar in large parts were the
systems of France and Spain (although in other parts, due to
the Gothic element in the Spanish, they were very different)&mdash;a
similarity which explains the facility with which O&rsquo;Reilly and
his successors introduced the Spanish laws after 1769. The
Louisiana code of 1808 was not, however, exhaustive; and the
courts continued to go back to the old Spanish sources whenever
the digest was inconclusive. Thus so late as 1819, when the
legislature ordered the compilation of such parts of King Alfonso&rsquo;s
<i>Siete Partidas</i> (the most common authority in the colony) as
were considered in force, this compilation filled a considerable
volume. In 1821 the legislature authorized Livingston to prepare
the &ldquo;Livingston Code&rdquo; of criminal law and procedure, completed
in 1824 (in French and English) and published in 1833, but never
adopted by the state. In 1825 legislative sanction was given to
the greater part of a civil code prepared by a commission (including
Livingston) appointed in 1821, and the French element
became steadily more important. In its present form the law
shows plainly the Latin and English elements. English law has
largely moulded, for example, criminal and commercial law and
the law of evidence; the development of the law of corporations,
damages, prohibitions and such extraordinary remedies as the
mandamus has been very similar to that in other states; while
in the fusion of law and equity, and the law of successions,
family relations, &amp;c., the civil law of Spain and France has
been unaffected.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;Schooling was very scant before the creation of the
public schools in 1854. Very little was done for education in the
French and Spanish period, although the Spanish governors made
commendable efforts in this regard; the first American Territorial
legislature began the incorporation of feeble &ldquo;colleges&rdquo; and
&ldquo;academies.&rdquo; To some of these the state gave financial aid
($1,613,898) before 1845. The public schools were flourishing at the
outbreak of the Civil War. War and reconstruction threw upon
them the new burden of the black children. The constitution of
1879 was illiberal in this respect, but a healthier public opinion soon
prevailed. The money given by the state to the public schools is
distributed among the parishes according to their school population,
and the constitution of 1898 set a generous <i>minimum</i> to such aid.
An annual poll-tax is also collected for the schools from every adult
male. Local taxes, besides, are imposed, and these are becoming
heavier. The parishes retain primary control of the schools. Institutes,
summer schools and rural libraries have been introduced.
The salaries of white teachers advanced from a monthly average of
$38.87 in 1903 to $61.84 in 1906. The average attendance of enrolled
black and white pupils is practically identical, but the enrolment
of whites (about 52% in 1902) is somewhat higher and that
of the blacks about a third lower than their ratio in the population.
The school term for white children is much longer than for negroes,
and white teachers are paid much better salaries&mdash;in 1906 the
average monthly salary of a negro teacher was $29.15. The total
enrolment is very low. But progress is now being made very rapidly
in the improvement of the educational system. Higher schools
include: the State University and Agricultural and Mechanical
College (1860) at Baton Rouge (<i>q.v.</i>); Tulane University of Louisiana
(1864) in New Orleans; Jefferson College (1864; Roman Catholic)
at Convent; the College of the Immaculate Conception (1847;
Roman Catholic) in New Orleans; St Charles College (1835; Roman
Catholic) at Grand Couteau; St Joseph&rsquo;s College (1849; Roman
Catholic) at Baton Rouge; the following colleges for women&mdash;Silliman
Collegiate Institute (1852; Presbyterian) at Clinton, Mansfield
Female College (1854; Methodist Episcopal, South) at Mansfield,
the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College for women (a part of
Tulane University) in New Orleans and the Louisiana Female
College (1856; Baptist) at Keatchie; the State Normal School of
Louisiana (1884) at Natchitoches and the New Orleans Normal and
Training School; the South-western Louisiana Industrial Institute
at Lafayette; the Louisiana Industrial Institute at Ruston; and,
among schools for negroes, the Peabody State Normal and Industrial
School at Alexandria and New Orleans University (1873; Methodist
Episcopal), Luther College (Evangelical Lutheran), Leland University
(1870; Baptist), Straight University (Congregational) and
Southern University (1883; aided by the state), all in New Orleans.</p>

<p><i>Charitable and Penal Institutions.</i>&mdash;The State Board of Charities
and Correction, for which the constitution of 1898 first made provision,
and which was organized under an act of 1904, is composed of
six members, appointed by the governor for six years, with the
governor as <i>ex-officio</i> chairman. The members of the board serve
gratuitously, but elect a salaried secretary. The board has no administrative
or executive power, but makes annual inspections of
all public charitable, correctional or reformatory institutions, all
private institutions which receive aid from, or are used by municipal
or parochial authorities, and all private asylums for the insane;
and reports annually to the governor on the actual condition of the
institutions. Any suggestions as to improvements in institutions
must be approved by the majority of the governing body of that
institution before they may be put into effect. The charitable
institutions include two charity hospitals&mdash;at New Orleans (1832)
and Shreveport; an Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, a Hôtel
Dieu, the Touro Infirmary and a Home for Incurables, all at New
Orleans; an Institute for the Deaf and Dumb (for whites&mdash;there is
no state provision for negro deaf and dumb) and an Institute for
the Blind, both at Baton Rouge; an Insane Hospital at Jackson
and another at Pineville; and the Louisiana Retreat for the Insane
at New Orleans. At Monroe there is a State Reform School, and at
New Orleans a Coloured Industrial Home and School. There is
also a state home for disabled Confederate soldiers at New Orleans
on Bayou St John. The State Penitentiary is at Baton Rouge, and
a House of Detention at New Orleans; and there are parish prisons.
State convicts, and all places in which they are confined or employed,
are under the supervision of a Board of Control appointed by the
governor. This board may allow commutation or diminution of
sentence for good behaviour, meritorious services or exemplary
conduct. The leasing or hiring of state convicts is prohibited by
the constitution, but parish convicts may be hired or leased for farm
and factory work, work on roads and levees, and other public undertakings.
Such convicts are classified according to physical ability
and a minimum rate is fixed for their hire, for not more than ten
hours a day. Many state convicts are employed in levee construction,
and there are convict farms at Angola, Hope, Oakley and
Monticello.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The early history of Louisiana belongs to the
romance of American history. It is possible that the mouth of
the Mississippi was discovered in 1519 by Alonso Alvarez de
Piñeda, but this interpretation of his vague manuscript remains
conjectural; and that it was discovered by the expedition of
Panfilo de Narvaez cannot be established. That Hernando de
Soto entered the borders of the present state of Louisiana, and
that his burial place in the Mississippi was where that river takes
the waters of the Red, are probable enough, but incapable of
conclusive proof. Survivors of de Soto&rsquo;s expedition, however,
descended the Mississippi to its mouth in 1542. Spain set up no
claim to the region, and when Robert Cavalier, Sieur de la Salle,
came down the river in 1682 from the French possessions to the
north, he took possession in the name of France, which hereby
gained her first title to the vast drainage basin of the Mississippi.
In honour of Louis XIV. the new possession was named &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo;&mdash;a
name then and until 1812 applied to a much larger
area than that of the present state. La Salle attempted to settle
a colony in 1684, but missed the Mississippi&rsquo;s mouth and landed
in Texas, where he was murdered in 1687 by some of his followers.
In 1697, after Ryswick, Pierre le Moyne d&rsquo;Iberville (1662-1706)
was chosen to lead another colony, which reached the Gulf coast
early in 1699. Soon after Iberville had built Fort Maurepas
(near the present city of Biloxi, Mississippi) in 1699, a fort was
erected on the Mississippi river about 40 m. above the mouth.</p>

<p>This was the earliest settlement in what is now the state of
Louisiana. It was unhealthy and unprosperous. From 1712 to
1717 &ldquo;Louisiana,&rdquo; or the French possessions of the Mississippi
valley, was held by Antoine Crozat (1655-1738) as a private
grant from the king. It proved as great a drain upon his purse
as it had proved to the crown, and he willingly parted with it to
the so-called &ldquo;Western Company,&rdquo; afterwards incorporated with
the great Company of the Indies. The head of this company
was John Law, who, after spreading glowing accounts of the new
land, launched his famous &ldquo;Mississippi scheme&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Law,
John</a></span>). The company accomplished much for the colony of
Louisiana. Jean Baptiste le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville (1680-1768),
a brother of Iberville, was sent out as governor. For
forty years he was the life of the colony. One of his first acts
was to found the city of New Orleans on its present site in 1718.
In this same year seven vessels were sent from France with stores
and immigrants; eleven followed during the next year. Five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
hundred negroes from the Guinea coast were imported in 1719,
and many hundreds more soon followed. The Law company
eventually came to an end fatal to its creditors in France, but
its misfortunes did not check the prosperity of &ldquo;Louisiana.&rdquo;
The company retained its grant of the colony until 1731, when it
reverted to the crown. Meantime New Orleans had become the
seat of government in 1722. In 1766 an official census showed a
total population of 5552. The years of royal rule were uneventful.
Cotton culture began in 1740, and sugar-cane was successfully
introduced from Santo Domingo by the Jesuits in 1751. Tafia
rum and a waxy, sticky sugar syrup subsequently became
important products; but not until the end of the century were
the means found to crystallize sugar and so give real prosperity
to the industry.</p>

<p>By a secret treaty of the 3rd of November 1762, &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo;
was transferred from France to Spain. This treaty was not made
public for a year and a half, and Spain did not take full possession
of the colony until 1769. By a treaty between Spain and France
on the one hand and Great Britain and Portugal on the other,
signed at Paris in February 1763, all that portion lying E. of the
Mississippi river, the Iberville river, and Lakes Maurepas and
Pontchartrain was ceded to Great Britain. The international
interests thus created, and others that sprang from them, heavily
burdened the diplomacy, and even threatened the safety of the
United States after they were placed in possession of the eastern
bank of the Mississippi down to 31° in 1783.</p>

<p>The news of the cession of the colony to Spain roused strong
discontent among the colonists. Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795),
a distinguished Spanish naval officer and scholar, came to New
Orleans in 1766 to take possession for his king. Merchants,
people, and many civil officers held toward him from the beginning
a hostile attitude; the military, especially, refused to pass
into the Spanish service as stipulated in the treaty; and Ulloa
was compelled to continue in an ambiguous and anomalous
position&mdash;which his lack of military force probably first compelled
him to assume&mdash;ruling the colony through the French
governor, Philippe Aubry (who loyally supported him throughout),
without publicly exhibiting his powers. The fear of
Spanish commercial laws powerfully stimulated resistance to
the transfer, and though Ulloa made commercial and monetary
concessions, they were not sufficient. When the colonists found
protests at Paris unavailing, they turned to the idea of independence,
but sought in vain the armed support of the British at
Pensacola. Nevertheless they compelled Ulloa to leave the colony
or exhibit his credentials. He took his leave in November 1768.
The open resistance by the colonists (October 1768) was a carefully
planned revolt. There is no doubt that the men who led
the Creole opposition contemplated independence, and this
gives the incident peculiar interest. In the summer of 1769
Alejandro O&rsquo;Reilly came to New Orleans with a strong military
force (3600 troops). Beginning his rule with an affability that
allayed suspicions and securing from Aubry proofs against the
popular leaders, he invited them to a reception and arrested
them while they were his guests. Five were put to death and
others were imprisoned at Havana. O&rsquo;Reilly put down the
rebellion with determination and in accord with the instructions
of his king. Regarded without republican sympathies, and in
the light of 18th-century doctrines of allegiance, his acts, however
severe, in no way deserve the stigma of cruelty ordinarily put
upon them. He was liberal and enlightened in his general rule.</p>

<p>Among the incidents of these troubled years was the arrival
in Louisiana (after 1765) of some hundreds of French exiles from
Acadia, who made their homes in the Attakapas country. There
their descendants live to-day, still somewhat primitively, and
still in somewhat of the glamour thrown over land and people
by the <i>Evangeline</i> of Longfellow.</p>

<p>On the 18th of August 1769 Louisiana was formally transferred
to Spain. Spanish law and Spanish tongue replaced the French
officially, but the colony remained essentially French. The
Spanish rulers made efforts to govern wisely and liberally, showing
great complaisance, particularly in heeding the profit of the
colony, even at the expense of Spanish colonial commercial
regulations. The judicial system was much improved, a better
grade of officials became the rule, many French Creoles were
appointed to office, intermarriages of French and Spanish and
even English were encouraged by the highest officials, and in
general a liberal and conciliatory policy was followed, which
made Louisiana under Spanish rule quiet and prosperous. Bernardo
de Galvez (1756-1794), a brilliant young officer of twenty-one,
when he became the governor of the colony, was one of the
most liberal of the Spanish rulers and of all the most popular.
During the American War of Independence he gave valuable
aid to the United States; and when Spain finally joined in the
war against Great Britain, Galvez, in a series of energetic and
brilliant campaigns (1779-1781), captured all the important
posts in the British colony of West Florida. The chief interest
of the Spanish period lies in the advance of settlement in the
western territories of the United States, the international
intrigues&mdash;British,
French and Spanish&mdash;involving the future of
the valley, the demand of the United States for free navigation
on the Mississippi, and the growing consciousness of the supreme
importance of the river and New Orleans to the Union. With
the Spanish governor Estevan Miro, who succeeded Galvez
in 1785, James Wilkinson of Kentucky, arrested at New Orleans
with a flat-boat of supplies in 1787, intrigued, promising him
that Kentucky would secede from the United States and would
join the Spanish; but Wilkinson was unsuccessful in his efforts
to carry out this plan. In 1794 Spain, hard pressed by Great
Britain and France, turned to the United States, and by the
treaty of 1794 the Mississippi river was recognized by Spain as
the western boundary of the United States, separating it from
Louisiana, and free navigation of the Mississippi was granted
to citizens of the United States, to whom was granted for three
years the right &ldquo;to deposit their merchandise and effects in the
port of New Orleans, and to export them from thence without
paying any other duty than a fair price for the hire of the stores.&rdquo;
At the expiration of the three years the Spanish governor refused
the use of New Orleans as a place of deposit, and contrary to
the treaty named no other port in its place. Spanish rule,
however, came unexpectedly to an end by the retrocession of
Louisiana to France in 1800; and French dominion gave way
in turn in 1803&mdash;as the result of a chain of events even more
unexpected, startling, and for the United States fortunate&mdash;to
the rule of the last-named country. On the 30th of November
1803 the representatives of the French republic received formal
possession from the Spanish governor, and on the 20th of December
lower Louisiana was transferred to the United States. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Louisiana Purchase</a></span>.)</p>

<p>By an Act of Congress of the 25th of March 1804,<a name="fa4q" id="fa4q" href="#ft4q"><span class="sp">4</span></a> that portion
of the Louisiana Purchase S. of 33° was organized as the Territory
of Orleans, and was given a government less democratic than
might otherwise have been the case, because it was intended
to prepare gradually for self-government the French and Spanish
inhabitants of the territory, who desired immediate statehood.
The foreign slave-trade was forbidden by this organic act.
English was made the official language. The introduction of
English law, and the changes made in the judicial and legal
systems of Louisiana after 1804 have already been described.</p>

<p>The machinations of Aaron Burr are of interest in connexion
with Louisiana annals, and likewise the settlement and revolutionizing
of West Florida by Americans. In November 1811
a convention met at New Orleans and framed a constitution under
which, on the 30th of April 1812, the Territory of Orleans became
the state of Louisiana. A few days later the portion of West
Florida between the Mississippi and Pearl rivers (the present
&ldquo;Florida Parishes&rdquo;) was included in its boundaries, making
them as they are to-day. In this same year the first steamboat
reached New Orleans. It descended the Ohio and Mississippi
from Pittsburg, whence there had already been a thriving river
trade to New Orleans for about thirty years. During the War
of 1812 a decisive victory was won by the American forces at
Chalmette, near New Orleans, on the 8th of January 1815. Up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
to 1860 the development of the state in population, agriculture
and commerce was very rapid. Donaldsonville was the (nominal)
capital in 1825-1831, Baton Rouge in 1849-1864 and again after
1882. At other times New Orleans has been the capital, and
here too have always been various state offices which in other
states ordinarily are in the state capital.</p>

<p>By an ordinance of secession passed on the 26th of January
1861, Louisiana joined the Confederate States. In the first year
there was very little military activity in the state, but in April
1862 Admiral D. G. Farragut, with a powerful fleet, ascended
the Mississippi past Forts Jackson and St Philip, which defended
the approach to New Orleans, and a military force under General
B. F. Butler occupied that city. The navigation of the river
being secured by this success and by later operations in the
north ending in July 1863 with the capture of Vicksburg and Port
Hudson, the state was wholly at the mercy of the Union armies.
The intervening months were signalized by the capture of Baton
Rouge in May 1862&mdash;the Confederates vainly attempting to
recapture it in August. Later, in April 1864, the Confederates
under General Richard Taylor won a success against the Unionists
under General N. P. Banks at Sabine Cross Roads near Mansfield
and were themselves repulsed at Pleasant Hill, these battles
being incidental to a campaign undertaken by the Union forces
to crush opposition in western Louisiana. A large portion of the
state was occupied by them in 1862-1865. There were various
minor skirmishes in 1862 and 1863 (including the capture of the
Federal camp at Berwick Bay in June 1863).</p>

<p>As early as December 1862 the Union military government,
at President Lincoln&rsquo;s direction, had ordered elections for
Congress, and the men chosen were admitted in February 1863.
In March 1864 also a state government to supersede the military
rule was established under the president&rsquo;s auspices. By 1863
two parties had arisen among the loyal classes: one of radicals,
who demanded the calling of a constitutional convention and
the abolition of slavery; the other of conservatives. The former
prevailed, and by a convention that assembled in April 1864
a constitution was framed closely following that of 1852 but
repudiating the debt incurred by Louisiana as one of the Confederate
states and abolishing slavery. Two-thirds of the
delegates were from New Orleans. The legislature was ordered
to establish free schools for the blacks, and was empowered to
give them the suffrage: neither of these provisions, however,
was carried out. The extent of the Union control is shown
by the fact that the legislature of 1864 represented half of the
area and two-thirds of the population of the state. The army
stood at the back of the new government, and by the end of
1864 Louisiana was apparently &ldquo;reconstructed.&rdquo; But in 1864
the opposition of Congress to presidential reconstruction had
clearly developed, so that the electoral votes of Louisiana (like
those of Tennessee) for president were not counted. By the
spring of 1866 the ex-Confederates had succeeded in gaining
possession of most of the local government and most of the
state offices, although not of the governorship. The Republican
party naturally became extremely radical. The radicals wished
to have negro suffrage in order to get possession of the government.
They, therefore, wanted still another constitutional
convention. A clause in the constitution of 1864 provided for
the reconvening of the convention in certain circumstances,
but this clause referred only to necessities prior to the establishment
of a government, and had therefore determined. Nevertheless,
the radicals, because it was impossible to call a convention
through the medium of the state government, took advantage
of this clause to reconvoke the old convention at New Orleans.
The day set was the 30th of July 1866. The ex-Confederate
party determined to prevent the gathering, but the idea of
interference by force seems to have been abandoned. A street
riot was precipitated, however, incidental to a procession of
armed negroes; the metropolitan police fired upon the assembled
convention; and altogether some 200 persons, mostly negroes,
were killed. This incident raised the crucial question of national
politics in 1866: namely, whether the states reconstructed by
the president should not again be reconstructed.</p>

<p>This being settled affirmatively, Louisiana was reconstructed
with vigour. A constitution of 1868 gave suffrage to the blacks,
and disfranchised all whites made ineligible to office under the
proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the national Constitution,
and also (practically) those who had by word, pen or vote
defended secession. Then the state ratified the Fourteenth
Amendment, and was declared readmitted to the Union in July
1868. Probably no other southern state suffered equally with
Louisiana from the corruption of &ldquo;carpet-bag,&rdquo; &ldquo;scalawag,&rdquo;
negro legislatures. For four years (1868-1872) the government
expenses increased to ten times their normal volume, taxation
was enormously increased, and about $57,000,000 of debt was
created. But a quarrel broke out among the Republicans
(1872), the result of which was the installation of two governors
and legislatures, one supported by the Democrats and Liberal
Republicans and the other by the radical Republicans, the former
being certainly elected by the people. The rivalry of these
two state governments, clashes of arms, the recognition by the
Federal authorities of the radical Republican government
(Pinchback and Kellogg, successively governors) followed. One
historic clash in New Orleans (on the 14th of September 1874)
between the &ldquo;White League&rdquo; (&ldquo;White Man&rsquo;s Party&rdquo;) and the
Republican police is commemorated by a monument, and the
day is regarded by Louisianans as a sort of state independence-day.
Finally, in 1876, Francis Tillon Nicholls (b. 1834), a
Democrat, was chosen governor, but the Republican candidate,
S. B. Packard, claimed the election, and with a Republican
legislature for a time occupied the State House. In the national
election of 1876 there were double returns (Republican: 75,315
for Hayes and 70,508 for Tilden; and Democratic: 83,723 for
Tilden and 77,174 for Hayes) from Louisiana, which, as was
the case with the double electoral returns from Florida, Oregon
and South Carolina, were adjudicated by the Electoral Commission
in favour of the Republican electors voting for Hayes.
Civil war being threatened within the state President Hayes
sent to Louisiana a commission composed of Wayne McVeagh,
Gen. J. R. Hawley, Charles B. Lawrence, J. M. Harlan, and
John C. Brown, ex-Governor of Tennessee, which was instructed
to promote &ldquo;an acknowledgment of one government within
the state.&rdquo; The rival legislatures united, organizing under the
Nicholls government, which the commission found was upheld
by public opinion. The president ordered the withdrawal of
Federal troops from the capitol on the 20th of April 1877, and
the white party was thus left in control.</p>

<p>After 1877 the state prospered markedly in all material
respects. Of subsequent political events perhaps the most
notable, besides the practical disfranchisement of the negroes,
are those connected with the Louisiana State Lottery Company
(1868-1893). For the renewal of its privileges in 1890 the
company finally agreed to give the state $1,250,000 yearly, and
despite strenuous opposition by a powerful party the legislature
voted a renewal, but this measure was vetoed by the governor.
The United States government, however, forbade lotteries the
use of the mails, and the company withdrew its offers. The
constitution of 1898 prohibits lotteries and the sale of lottery
tickets within the state. In 1891 the lynching of eleven Italians
at New Orleans gave rise to grave difficulties involving Italy,
the United States, and the state of Louisiana. Since 1900 a
white Republican Party has made some headway in Louisiana
politics, but in national and state elections the state has been
uninterruptedly and overwhelmingly Democratic since 1877.</p>

<p>For history: the standard work is that of Charles E. A. Gayarré,
coming down to the war, based on deep and scholarly research, and
greatly altered in successive editions. The style is that of the classic
school, that of Prescott and Motley, full of colour, characterization
and spirit. The editions are as follows: <i>Romance of the History of
Louisiana</i> (New York, 1837, 1848); <i>Histoire de la Louisiane</i> (2 vols.,
Nouvelle Orléans, 1846-1847); <i>Louisiana: its Colonial History and
Romance</i> (N.Y., 1851); <i>Louisiana: its History as a French Colony</i>,
Third Series of Lectures (N.Y., 1852); then, based upon the preceding,
<i>History of Louisiana: The French Domination</i> (2 vols., N.Y.,
1854) and <i>The Spanish Domination</i> (N.Y., 1854); <i>The American
Domination</i> (N.Y., 1867); and third edition (4 vols., New Orleans,
1885). More important for the recent period is Alcée Fortier; <i>A History
of Louisiana</i> (N.Y., 4 vols., 1904) devoting two volumes to American
domination. The <i>History and General Description of New France</i>
of P. F. X. de Charlevoix (best ed. by J. G. Shea, New York, 1866,
6 vols.) is a famous old work, but now negligible. Judge F. X.
Martin&rsquo;s <i>History of Louisiana</i> (2 vols., New Orleans, 1827-1829,
later ed. by J. F. Condon, continued to 1861, New Orleans, 1882)
is also valuable and supplements Gayarré. Le Page du Pratz,
author of <i>Histoire de la Louisiane</i> (3 vols., Paris, 1758; 2 vols.,
London, 1763), was the first historian of Louisiana. Berquin-Duvallon,
<i>Vue de la colonie espagnole du Mississippi</i> (Paris, 1805;
published in English under the name of John Davis, New York,
1806); L. N. Baudry de Lozières, <i>Voyage à la Louisiane</i> (Paris,
1802) and <i>Second Voyage à la Louisiane</i> (Paris, 1803) may be
mentioned among the travels just preceding, and A. Stoddard,
<i>Sketches of Louisiana</i> (New York, 1811), among those just following
the establishment of American dominion. The <i>Histoire de la
Louisiane, et de la cession de colonie par la France aux États-Unis</i>
(Paris, 1829; in English, Philadelphia, 1830) by Barbé-Marbois
has great importance in diplomatic history. The rarest and most
valuable of early memoirs and much archive material are embodied
in Benj. F. French&rsquo;s <i>Historical Collections of Louisiana</i> (5 series, N.Y.,
1846-1853) and <i>Historical Collections of Louisiana and Florida</i>,
New Series (N.Y., 1869, 1875). Documentary materials on the
greater &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo; between the Gulf of Mexico and Canada will
be found in the <i>Jesuit Relations</i>, edited by R. G. Thwaites (Cleveland,
1896 ff.); and on early voyages in Pierre Margry, <i>Découvertes et
établissements des Français</i> (6 vols., Paris, 1879-1888). John G.
Shea published an edition of Louis Hennepin&rsquo;s <i>Description of Louisiana ...
Translated from the Edition of 1683</i>, &amp;c. (New York, 1880).

<p><span class="bold">LOUISIANA,<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> a city of Pike county, Missouri, U.S.A., situated
below the mouth of the Salt river, on the western bank of the
Mississippi, about 90 m. N. of St. Louis. Pop. (1900) 5131, including
1075 negroes and 161 foreign-born; (1910) 4454; there
is also a considerable suburban population. Louisiana is served
by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy and the Chicago &amp; Alton
railways, and by several lines of river steamboats. The river is
spanned here by a railway bridge. The city is laid out fairly
regularly in the river valley and on bluffs along the river, and
has attractive residential districts, commanding good views.
It has very active and varied industries, and is a trade centre
for a large grain- and fruit-producing and stock-raising region,
and has one of the largest nurseries in the United States.
Louisiana was laid out in 1818, was the county-seat from that
date until 1825, was incorporated as a town in 1845 and was
chartered as a city in 1849.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUISIANA PURCHASE,<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> a large portion of the area of the
United States of America, purchased from the French Republic
in 1803. The territory to which France held explorer&rsquo;s title
originally included the entire valley of the Mississippi (see
Louisiana); but the &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo; which was ceded by her to
Spain in 1762 (England refusing it, preferring the Floridas),
retroceded to France in 1800,<a name="fa1r" id="fa1r" href="#ft1r"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and ceded by Napoleon to the
United States&mdash;in violation of his pledge to Spain that he would
not alienate the province&mdash;embraced only the portion W. of
the river and the island of New Orleans on the E. (and, as might
be claimed with some show of argument, West Florida to the
Perdido river).</p>

<p>With the settlement of the trans-Alleghany region, the freedom
of the Mississippi had become of vital importance to the western
settlements, and Spain had recognized these interests in her
treaty with the United States of 1795, by guaranteeing freedom
of navigation and the privilege of deposit at New Orleans.
The transfer of Louisiana from a weak neighbour to so powerful
and ambitious a state as France was naturally unwelcome to the
United States, and Robert R. Livingston, the American minister
in Paris, was instructed by Secretary-of-State Madison to
endeavour to prevent the consummation of the retrocession;
or, should that be irrevocable, to endeavour to buy the Floridas
(either from France, if they had passed with Louisiana, or through
her goodwill from Spain)&mdash;or at least West Florida&mdash;and if
possible New Orleans, so as to give the United States a secure
position on the Mississippi, and insure the safety of her commerce.
The United States was also trying to collect claims of her
merchants for spoliations by French cruisers during the late
war between France and Great Britain. In his preliminary
propositions Livingston lightly suggested to Talleyrand a cession
of Louisiana to satisfy these claims; following it with the
more serious demand that France should pledge observance of
the Spanish concession to the Mississippi trade. This pledge
Napoleon readily gave. But during these negotiations a suspension
by the Spanish governor of the right of deposit aroused
extreme apprehension in America and resulted in warlike votes
in Congress. Of these, and of London reports of a British
expedition against New Orleans preparing in anticipation of the
imminent rupture of the peace of Amiens, Livingston made
most capable use; and pressed for a cession of West Florida,
New Orleans and Louisiana north of the Arkansas river. But
without New Orleans Louisiana was of little present worth, and
Napoleon&mdash;the collapse of whose American colonial schemes
seemed involved in his failure in Santo Domingo, who was
persuaded he could not hold Louisiana against Great Britain,
and who was already turning from projects of colonial empire
toward his later continental policy&mdash;suddenly offered to Livingston
the whole of the province. Livingston disclaimed wanting
the part below the Arkansas. In even mentioning Louisiana he
had gone outside his instructions. At this stage James Monroe
became associated with him in the negotiations. They were
quickly closed, Barbé Marbois acting for Napoleon, and by
three conventions signed on the 30th of April 1803 the American
ministers, without instructions, boldly accepted for their country
a territory approximately 1,000,000 sq. m. in area&mdash;about five
times the area of continental France. For this imperial domain,
perhaps the richest agricultural region of the world, the United
States paid 60,000,000 francs ($11,250,000) outright, and
assumed the claims of her citizens against France to the extent
of 20,000,000 francs ($3,750,000) additional; the interest
payments incidental to the final settlement raising the total
eventually to $27,267,622, or about four cents an acre.</p>

<p>Different writers have emphasized differently the various
factors in this extraordinary diplomatic episode. Unquestionably
the western people were ready to war for the navigation
of the Mississippi; but, that being guaranteed, it seems certain
that France might peaceably have taken and held the western
shore. The acquisition was not a triumph of American diplomacy,
but a piece of marvellous diplomatic good fortune; for the
records abundantly prove, as Madison said, that the cause of
success was a sudden policy of Napoleon, forced by European contingencies.
Livingston alone of the public men concerned showed
indubitably before the event a conception of the feasibility
and desirability of the acquisition of a vast territory beyond
the Mississippi. Jefferson had wished to buy the Floridas,
but alarmed by the magnitude of the cession, declared his
belief that the United States had no power to acquire Louisiana.
Though such strict construction of the constitution was a
cardinal dogma of the Democratic party, this dogma was
abandoned outright in practice, Jefferson finding &ldquo;but one
opinion as to the necessity of shutting up the constitution&rdquo;
(or amending it, which was not done) and seeking justification
of the means in the end. The Federalist party, heretofore
broad-constructionists, became strict-constructionists under
the temptation of factious politics, and a very notable political
struggle was thus precipitated&mdash;notable among other things for
strong expressions of sectionalism. The net result was the
establishment of the doctrine of &ldquo;implied powers&rdquo; in interpreting
the constitution; a doctrine under which the Supreme
Court presently found power to acquire territory implied in the
powers to wage war and make peace, negotiate treaties, and
&ldquo;dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting
the territory or other property belonging to the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exact limits of the acquisition were not definitely drawn.
The French archives show that Napoleon regarded the Rio
Grande as the W. boundary of the territory of which he was
to take possession, and the United States up to 1819 ably
maintained the same claim. She also claimed all West Florida
as part of Louisiana&mdash;which, in the usage of the second half
of the 18th century, it apparently was not. When she acquired
the Floridas in 1819-1821 she abandoned the claim to Texas.
The line then adopted between the American and Spanish
possessions on the W. followed the Sabine river from the Gulf
of Mexico to the parallel of 32° N., ran thence due N. to the
Red river, followed this to the meridian of 100° W. and this
line N. to the Arkansas river, thence along this to its source,
thence N. to the parallel of 42°, and along this line to the Pacific.
Such is the accepted description of the W. boundary of the
Louisiana Purchase&mdash;waiving Texas&mdash;thus retrospectively determined,
except that that boundary ran with the crest of the Rocky
Mountains N. of its intersection with the parallel of 42°. No
portion of the Purchase lay west of the mountains, although for
some years after 1870 the official maps of the United States
government erroneously included Oregon as so acquired&mdash;an
error finally abandoned by 1900.</p>

<p>On the 20th of December 1803, at New Orleans, the United
States took possession of the lower part of the province, and
on the 9th of March 1804, at St Louis, of the upper. The entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
region then contained possibly 80,000 residents. The treaty of
cession required the incorporation of Louisiana in the Union, and
the admission of its inhabitants, &ldquo;as soon as possible, according
to the principles of the Federal Constitution, to the enjoyment
of all the rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the
United States.&rdquo; By act of the 26th of March 1804 the region
below 33° N. was organized as the Territory of Orleans (see
Louisiana), and that above as the District of Louisiana. The
region above 33°, renamed in 1805 the Territory of Louisiana,
and in 1812 the Territory of Missouri, was divided as time went
on into many Indian reservations, territories and states. Thus
were carved from the great domain of the Purchase Louisiana,
Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, North and South Dakota,
Nebraska and Oklahoma in their entirety, and much the greatest
part of Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana. There is
justification for the saying of Thiers that the United States
were &ldquo;indebted for their birth and for their greatness&rdquo;&mdash;at least
for an early assurance of greatness&mdash;&ldquo;to the long struggle
between France and England.&rdquo; The acquisition of so vast a
territory proved thus of immense influence in the history of the
United States. It made it possible for them to hold a more
independent and more dignified position between France and
England during the Napoleonic wars; it established for ever
in practice the doctrine of implied powers in the interpretation
of the Federal Constitution; it gave the new republic a grand
basis for material greatness; assured its dominance in North
America; afforded the field for a magnificent experiment in
expansion, and new doctrines of colonization; fed the national
land hunger; incidentally moulded the slavery issue; and
precipitated its final solution.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that after the Revolution and the Civil
War, the Louisiana Purchase is the greatest fact in American
history. In 1904 a world&rsquo;s fair, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,
was held at St Louis in commemoration of the cession.
After one hundred years the wilderness then acquired had
become the centre of the power and wealth of the Union. It
contained in 1903 15,000,000 inhabitants, and its taxable wealth
alone was four hundred times the fifteen millions given to
Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUISVILLE,<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> the largest city of Kentucky, U.S.A., and the
county-seat of Jefferson county, on the Ohio river, 110 m. by
rail and 130 m. by water S.W. of Cincinnati. Pop. (1890) 161,129;
(1900) 204,731, of whom 21,427 were foreign-born (including
12,383 Germans and 4198 Irish) and 39,139 were negroes;
(1910 census) 223,928.</p>

<p>Louisville occupies 40 sq. m. of a plain, about 70 sq. m. in
extent, about 60 ft. above the low-water mark of the river,
and nearly enclosed by hills. The city extends for 8 m. along the
river (spanned here by three bridges), which falls 26 ft. in 2 m.,
but for 6 m. above the rapids spreads out into a beautiful sheet
of quiet water about 1 m. wide. The streets intersect at right
angles, are from 60 to 120 ft. wide, and are, for the most part,
well-shaded. The wholesale district, with its great tobacco
warehouses, is largely along Main Street, which runs E. and W.
not far from the river; and the heart of the shopping district is
along Fourth Street in the dozen blocks S. of Main Street.
Adjoining the shopping district on the S. is the old residence
section; the newer residences are on &ldquo;The Highlands&rdquo; at the
E. end and also at the W. end. The city is served by the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio South-Western, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, the
Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis, the Louisville,
Henderson &amp; St Louis, the Illinois Central, the Chicago, Indiana
&amp; Louisville, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis,
the Southern and the Louisville &amp; Nashville railways; by steamboat
lines to Memphis, Cairo, Evansville, Cincinnati and Pittsburg;
by an extensive system of inter-urban electric lines;
and by ferries to Jeffersonville and New Albany, Indiana, two
attractive residential suburbs.</p>

<p>Many of the business houses are old-fashioned and low.
The principal public buildings are the United States government
building, the Jefferson county court house and the city hall.
In front of the court house stands a bronze statue of Thomas
Jefferson, designed by Moses Ezekiel (b. 1844), and inside of the
court house a marble statue of Henry Clay by Joel T. Hart (1810-1870).
There are few or no large congested tenement-house
districts; most of the wage-earners own their own homes or rent
cottages. Louisville has an extensive park system, most of
which was acquired after 1889 and is on the outskirts. From
the heart of the city South Parkway, 150 ft. wide, extends S.
6 m. to the entrance to Iroquois Park (670 acres) on a wooded hill.
At the E. end of Broadway is Cherokee Park (nearly 330 acres),
near which is the beautiful Cave Hill Cemetery, containing the
grave of George Rogers Clark, the founder of the city, and the
graves of several members of the family of George Keats, the
poet&rsquo;s brother, who lived in Louisville for a time; and at the
W. end of Broadway, Shawnee Park (about 170 acres), with a
long sandy river beach frequented by bathers. Central Park
occupies the space of two city squares in the old fashionable
residence districts. Through the efforts of a Recreation League
organized in 1901 a few playgrounds are set apart for children.
Louisville is a noted racing centre and has some fine tracks; the
Kentucky Derby is held here annually in May.</p>

<p>The United States government has a marine hospital, and a
life-saving station at the rapids of the river. The state has a
school for the blind, in connexion with which is the American
Printing House for the Blind. There are state hospitals and
many other charitable institutions.</p>

<p>The principal educational institutions are the university of
Louisville, which has a College of Liberal Arts (1907), a law
department (1847), and a medical department (1837)&mdash;with
which in 1907 were consolidated the Hospital College of Medicine
(1873), the Medical Department of Kentucky University (1898),
the Louisville Medical College (1869), and the Kentucky School
of Medicine (1850); the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
(1859); the Presbyterian Theological Seminary of Kentucky,
which was formed in 1901 by the consolidation of the Theological
Seminary of the Presbyterian Church at Danville (1853) and
the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary (1893); the
Louisville College of Pharmacy (1871), and the Louisville College
of Dentistry (1887), a department of Central University. There
are many musical clubs, and a spring festival for which a local
chorus furnishes the nucleus, is held annually. The Louisville
Public Library was established in 1902, and 1904 acquired the
library, the small museum (containing the Troost collection of
minerals) and the art gallery of the Polytechnic Society of Louisville
(1878), which for many years had maintained the only public
library in the city. The principal newspapers are the <i>Courier
Journal</i> (Democratic, morning), the <i>Herald</i> (Republican,
morning), the <i>Evening Post</i> (Independent Democratic), and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
<i>Times</i> (Democratic, evening). The <i>Courier Journal</i> is one of the
most influential newspapers in the South. Henry Watterson
became editor in 1868, when the <i>Courier</i> (1843), established and
owned by Walter N. Haldeman, was consolidated with the
<i>Journal</i> (1830), of which Watterson had become editor in 1867,
and with the <i>Democrat</i> (1844).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The richness of the surrounding country in agricultural produce,
timber, coal and iron, and its transport facilities have made Louisville
a large commercial and manufacturing centre. The leaf-tobacco
market is the largest in the world, most of the leaf-tobacco
produced in Kentucky, which in 1900 was 34.9% of the entire crop
of the United States, being handled in Louisville; the city&rsquo;s trade
in whisky, mules and cement<a name="fa1s" id="fa1s" href="#ft1s"><span class="sp">1</span></a> is notably large, and that in pork,
wheat, Indian corn, coal and lumber is extensive. The total value
of the manufactured products increased from $54,515,226 in 1890
to $78,746,390 in 1900 or 44.4%, and between 1900 and 1905 the
value of the factory-made product increased from $66,110,474 to
$83,204,125, an increase of 25.9%. Large quantities of fine
bourbon whisky are distilled here; in 1905 the value of the factory
product of the city was $3,878,004. The most valuable manufacture
in the same year was smoking and chewing tobacco (especially
plug tobacco) and snuff valued at $11,635,367&mdash;which product
with that of cigars and cigarettes ($1,225,347) constituted 15.5%
of the value of the factory products of the city. Other important
manufactures in 1905 were: packed meats, particularly pork;
men&rsquo;s clothing, especially &ldquo;Kentucky jeans&rdquo;; flour and grist mill
products; cotton-seed oil and cake; leather, especially sole leather;
foundry and machine shop products; steam-railway cars; cooperage;
malt liquors; carriages and wagons, especially farm wagons;
and carriage and wagon materials; agricultural implements,
especially ploughs; and plumbers&rsquo; supplies, including cast-iron gas
and water pipes. Besides, there were many other manufactures.</p>

<p>The city&rsquo;s water-supply is taken from the Ohio river a few miles
above the city limits, and purified by large filtering plants. Nearly
all the capital stock of the water-works company is owned by the
municipality.</p>

<p>Louisville is governed under a charter of 1893, which is in the form
of an act of the state legislature for the government of cities of the
first class (Louisville is the only city of the first class in the state).
The mayor is elected for four years, and appoints, subject to the
approval of the board of aldermen, the controller and the members
of the two principal executive boards&mdash;the board of public works
and the board of public safety. The legislative power is vested in
a general council composed of 12 aldermen and 24 councilmen.
Both aldermen and councilmen serve without pay, and are elected
on a general ticket for a term of two years; not more than two
councilmen may be residents of the same ward, but there is no such
limitation in regard to aldermen. The treasurer, tax-receiver,
auditor, judge of the police court, clerk of the police court, members
of the board of school trustees (1 from each legislative district)
and members of the park commission are elected by popular vote;
the assessor, by the general council. The duration of franchises
given by the city is limited to 20 years.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The site of the city was probably visited by La Salle
in 1669 or 1670. In July 1773, Captain Thomas Bullitt,<a name="fa2s" id="fa2s" href="#ft2s"><span class="sp">2</span></a> acting
under a commission from the College of William and Mary,
surveyed a tract of 2000 acres, lying opposite the Falls of the
Ohio, and laid out a town site upon this tract. Colonel William
Preston, county surveyor of Fincastle county, within which the
2000-acre tract lay, refused to approve Captain Bullitt&rsquo;s survey,
and had the lands resurveyed in the following year, nevertheless
the tract was conveyed in December 1773 by Lord Dunmore
to his friend Dr John Connolly, a native of Lancaster county,
Pennsylvania, who had served in the British army, as commander
of Fort Pitt (under Dunmore&rsquo;s appointment), was an
instigator of Indian troubles which culminated in the Battle of
Point Pleasant, and was imprisoned from 1775 until nearly the
close of the War of American Independence for attempting under
Dunmore&rsquo;s instructions to organize the &ldquo;Loyal Foresters,&rdquo; who
were to be sent against the rebellious colonists in the West. The
city of Louisville was laid out on the upper half of this Connolly
tract. It is possible that there was a settlement on what was
afterward called Corn Island (which has now practically disappeared),
at the Falls of the Ohio, as early as 1775; in May
1778, General George Rogers Clark, while proceeding, by way
of the Ohio river, against the British posts in the Illinois territory,
landed on this island and built block-houses for his stores
and cabins for about twenty families of emigrants who had
come with him. These emigrants (or the greater part of them)
removed to the mainland in the winter of 1778-1779, and established
themselves in a fort built within the present limits of Louisville.
A town government was organized by them in April 1779,
the settlement at this time being known as &ldquo;the Falls of the
Ohio.&rdquo; On the 14th of May 1780, the legislature of Virginia, in
response to a petition of the inhabitants, declared that Connolly
had forfeited his title, and incorporated the settlement under
the name of Louisville, in recognition of the assistance given to
the colonies in the War of Independence by Louis XVI. of France.
In 1828 Louisville was chartered as a city; in 1851 it received a
second city charter; in 1870, a third; and in 1893, a fourth.
The city&rsquo;s growth was greatly promoted by the introduction of
successful steam navigation on the Ohio in 1811 and still further
by the opening of the canal around the rapids (generally called
the &ldquo;Falls of the Ohio&rdquo;). This canal, which is 2½ m. in length
and is known as the Louisville and Portland canal, was authorized
by the legislature in 1825 and was opened in December 1830;
between 1855 and 1872 Congress made appropriations for
enlarging it, and in 1874 it passed entirely under Federal
control. The first railway to serve the city, the Louisville
&amp; Frankfort, was completed in 1851. The 6th of August is
locally known as &ldquo;Bloody Monday&rdquo;; on this day in 1855 some
members of the Know Nothing Party incited a riot that resulted
in the loss of several lives and of considerable property. In
March 1890 a tornado caused great loss in life and property in
the city. General Clark made his home in Louisville and the
vicinity after his return from the Illinois country in 1779.
Louisville was also the early home of the actress Mary Anderson;
John James Audubon lived here in 1808-1812; and 5 m. E. of
the city are the old home and the grave (with a monument) of
Zachary Taylor.</p>

(formerly the province of Algarve); beautifully situated in an
inland hilly district, 10 m. N.N.W. of the seaport of Faro and
5 m. from São João da Venda on the Lisbon-Faro railway.
Pop. (1900) 22,478. Apart from Lisbon, Oporto and Braga,
Loulé is the most populous town in the kingdom. It is surrounded
by walls and towers dating from the Moorish period.
The neighbouring church of Nossa Senhora da Piedade is a

<p><span class="bold">LOURDES,<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> a town of south-western France in the department
of Hautes-Pyrénées, at the foot of the Pyrenees, 12 m. S.S.W.
of Tarbes on the main line of the Southern railway between that
town and Pau. Pop. (1906) 7228. Lourdes is divided into an
old and a new town by the Gave de Pau, which at this point
leaves the valley of Argelès and turns abruptly to the west. The
old quarter on the right bank surrounds on three sides a scarped
rock, on which stands the fortress now used as a prison. Its large
square keep of the 14th century is the chief survival of feudal
times. Little is left of the old fortifications except a tower of
the 13th or 14th century, surmounting a gateway known as the
Tour de Garnabie. The old quarter is united with the new town
by a bridge which is continued in an esplanade leading to the
basilica, the church of the Rosary and the Grotto, with its spring
of healing water. The present fame of Lourdes is entirely
associated with this grotto, where the Virgin Mary is believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
in the Roman Catholic world to have revealed herself repeatedly
to a peasant girl named Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. A statue
of the Virgin stands on a rock projecting above the grotto, the
walls of which are covered with crutches and other votive offerings;
the spot, which is resorted to by multitudes of pilgrims
from all quarters of the world, is marked by a basilica built above
the grotto and consecrated in 1876. In addition the church of
the Rosary, a rich building in the Byzantine style, was erected
in front of and below the basilica from 1884 to 1889. Not far
from the grotto are several other caves, where prehistoric
remains have been found. The Hospice de Notre-Dame de
Douleurs is the chief of the many establishments provided for
the accommodation of pilgrims.</p>

<p>Lourdes is a fortified place of the second class; and is the seat
of the tribunal of first instance of the arrondissement of Argelès.
There are marble and slate quarries near the town. The pastures
of the neighbourhood support a breed of Aquitaine cattle, which is
most highly valued in south-western France.</p>

<p>The origin of Lourdes is uncertain. From the 9th century
onwards it was the most important place in Bigorre, largely
owing to the fortress which is intimately connected with its
history. In 1360 it passed by the treaty of Brétigny from
French to English hands, and its governor was murdered by
Gaston Phoebus viscount of Béarn, for refusing to surrender it
to the count of Anjou. Nevertheless the fortress did not fall
into the possession of the French till 1406 after a blockade of
eighteen months. Again during the wars of religion the castle
held out successfully after the town had been occupied by the
troops of the Protestant captain Gabriel, count of Montgomery.
From the reign of Louis XIV. to the beginning of the 19th
century the castle was used as a state prison. Since the visions
of Bernadette Soubirous, their authentication by a commission of
enquiry appointed by the bishop of Tarbes, and the authorization
by the pope of the cult of Our Lady of Lourdes, the quarter on
the left bank of the Gave has sprung up and it is estimated that
600,000 pilgrims annually visit the town. The chief of the
pilgrimages, known as the national pilgrimage, takes place in
August.</p>

<p>Several religious communities have been named after Our
Lady of Lourdes. Of these one, consisting of sisters of the third
order of St Francis, called the Congregation of Our Lady of
Lourdes (founded 1877), has its headquarters in Rochester,
Minnesota. Another, the Order of Our Lady of Lourdes, was
founded in 1883 for work in the archdiocese of New Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOURENÇO MARQUES,<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> capital of Portuguese East Africa,
or Mozambique, on the north bank of the Espirito Santo or
English river, Delagoa Bay, and 396 m. by rail via Pretoria
from Johannesburg. Pop. (1904) 9849, of whom 4691 were
Europeans and 1690 Asiatics. The town is situated close to
the mouth of the river in 25° 53&prime; S. and 32° 30&prime; E., and is built
upon a low-lying spit of sand, formerly surrounded by swamps.
The streets are regularly laid out and adorned by several fine
buildings. The principal thoroughfare, the Avenida Aguiar,
2 m. long, goes from the centre of the town to Reuben Point.
The harbour is well equipped with piers, quays, landing sheds
and electric cranes, which enable large steamers to discharge
cargoes direct into the railway trucks. The depth of water at
low tide is 18 ft. The streets are lit by electricity and there is
an electric tramway system 7 m. in extent. At Reuben Point,
which marks the spot where the English river enters the bay,
are the lighthouse, barracks and the private residences of the
wealthy citizens. At its mouth the English river is about
2 m. across. Lourenço Marques is the nearest seaport to the
Rand gold mines. The port is 8374 m. from Southampton via
Cape Town and 7565 m. via the Suez canal. It is served by
British, Portuguese and German liners, the majority of the
goods imported being shipped at Southampton, Lisbon or
Hamburg. Over 50% of the import trade of Johannesburg
is with Lourenço Marques. Great Britain and British possessions
take some 40% of the import trade, Portugal, Germany, Norway,
Sweden and America coming next in order. Most of the imports,
being forwarded to the Transvaal, figure also as exports. The
chief articles of import are food-stuffs and liquors, iron, mineral
oils, inks and dyes, timber and live stock. These all form part
of the transit trade. There is practically no export trade by sea
save in coal, which is brought chiefly from the collieries at
Middelburg in the Transvaal. At Port Matolla, 20 m. from the
town, on the river of that name, one of the feeders of the English
river, is a flourishing timber trade. The average value of the
total trade of Lourenço Marques for the five years 1897-1899
and 1902-1903 (1900 and 1901 being years during which trade
was disorganized by the Anglo-Boer War) was over £3,500,000.
In 1905 the value of the trade of the port was £5,682,000; of
this total the transit trade was worth over £4,500,000 and the
imports for local consumption £1,042,000. The retail trade, and
trade with the natives, is almost entirely in the hands of Indians.
The chief import for local consumption is cheap wine from
Portugal, bought by the Kaffirs to the extent of over £500,000
yearly. These natives form the bulk of the Africans who work
in the Rand gold mines.</p>

<p>Lourenço Marques is named after a Portuguese navigator,
who with a companion (Antonio Calderia) was sent in 1544 by
the governor of Mozambique on a voyage of exploration. They
explored the lower courses of the rivers emptying their waters
into Delagoa Bay, notably the Espirito Santo. The various
forts and trading stations which the Portuguese established,
abandoned and re-occupied on the north bank of the river were
all called Lourenço Marques. The existing town dates from
about 1850, the previous settlement having been entirely destroyed
by the natives. In 1871 the town was described as a poor
place, with narrow streets, fairly good flat-roofed houses,
grass huts, decayed forts and rusty cannon, enclosed by a wall
6 ft. high then recently erected and protected by bastions at
intervals. The growing importance of the Transvaal led, however,
to greater interest being taken in Portugal in the port.
A commission was sent by the Portuguese government in 1876
to drain the marshy land near the settlement, to plant the blue
gum tree, and to build a hospital and a church. It was not,
however, until the end of the 19th century that any marked
development took place in the town, and up to 1903 cargo had
to be discharged in tugs and lighters.</p>

<p>In 1873-1877 Mr Burgers, president of the Transvaal, endeavoured,
unsuccessfully, to get a railway built from Pretoria
to Delagoa Bay. In 1878-1879 a survey was taken for a line
from Lourenço Marques to the Transvaal, and in 1883 the Lisbon
cabinet granted to Colonel Edward McMurdo, an American
citizen, a concession&mdash;which took the place of others which had
lapsed&mdash;for the building of a railway from Lourenço Marques
to the Transvaal frontier, the Boer government having agreed
(1883) to continue the line to Pretoria. Under this concession
Colonel McMurdo formed in London in 1887 a company&mdash;the
Delagoa Bay and East African Railway Company&mdash;to construct
the line. Meantime a secret agreement had been come to
between President Kruger and Portugal for the concession to
the Transvaal of a &ldquo;steam tramway&rdquo; parallel to the projected
railway, should the company not complete the line in the time
specified. The company, however, built the line to the frontier
shown on the Portuguese maps of 1883 within the time limit,
the railway being opened on the 14th of December 1888. The
frontier by this date had been fixed at Komati Poort, 5 m.
farther from the coast. Portugal had previously agreed to grant
the company &ldquo;a reasonable extension of time&rdquo; to complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
the line if the frontier should be traced farther inland than shown
on the 1883 maps. The Lisbon government required the extension
to Komati Poort to be completed in eight months (five of
which were in the rainy season), an impossible stipulation. The
railway not being finished, the Portuguese seized the line on the
25th of June 1889 and cancelled the concession. Portugal in
so doing acted, to all appearance, under pressure from the
Transvaal. Great Britain and America at once protested,
Portugal admitted the illegality of her act and consented to
refer the amount of compensation to the decision of three Swiss
jurists. This was in 1890, when Portugal paid £28,000 on
account. It was not until the 29th of March 1900 that the award
was made known. The arbitrators ordered Portugal to pay&mdash;in
addition to the £28,000&mdash;a sum, including interest, of £950,000.
The damages were promptly paid. Meantime the railway had
been continued from Komati Poort and was opened for through
traffic to Pretoria on the 8th of July 1895. In 1906-1910
another railway (47 m. long) was built from Lourenço Marques
due west to the Swaziland frontier, being a link in a new line
to shorten the distance by rail between the Rand and the sea
by some 60 m.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUSE<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>lús</i>, cf. Du. <i>luis</i>, Ger. <i>Laus</i>, Dan. and Swed.
<i>lus</i>), a term applied to small wingless insects, parasitic upon
birds and mammals, and belonging strictly speaking to the order
Anoplura, often included among the Hemiptera, though the term
is frequently extended to the bird-lice constituting the suborder
Mallophaga, formerly included among the Neuroptera.
Both agree in having nothing that can be termed a metamorphosis;
they are active from the time of their exit from the
egg to their death, gradually increasing in size, and undergoing
several moults or changes of skin. The true lice (or Anoplura)
are found on the bodies of many Mammalia, and occasion by
their presence intolerable irritation. The number of genera
is few. Two species of <i>Pediculus</i> are found on the human body,
and are known ordinarily as the head-louse (<i>P. capitis</i>) and the
body-louse (<i>P. vestimenti</i>); <i>P. capitis</i> is found on the head,
especially of children. The eggs, laid on the hairs, and known
as &ldquo;nits,&rdquo; hatch in about eight days, and the lice are full grown
in about a month. Such is their fecundity that it has been
asserted that one female (probably of <i>P. vestimenti</i>) may in
eight weeks produce five thousand descendants. Want of
cleanliness favours their multiplication in a high degree&mdash;the
idea once existed, and is probably still held by the very ignorant,
that they are directly engendered from dirt. The irritation is
caused by the rostrum of the insect being inserted into the skin,
from which the blood is rapidly pumped up. A third human
louse, known as the crab-louse (<i>Phthirius pubis</i>) is found amongst
the hairs on other parts of the body, particularly those of the
pubic region, but probably never on the head. The louse of
monkeys is now generally considered as forming a separate
genus (<i>Pedicinus</i>), but the greater part of those infesting domestic
and wild quadrupeds are mostly grouped in the large genus
<i>Haematopinus</i>, and very rarely is the same species found on
different kinds of animals.</p>

<p>The bird-lice (Mallophaga) are far more numerous in species,
although the number of genera is comparatively small. With
the exception of the genus <i>Trichodectes</i>, the various species of
which are found on mammalia, all infest birds (as their English
names implies) (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bird-Louse</a></span>). Louse-infestation is known
as phthiriasis in medical and veterinary terminology.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUTH,<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> a maritime county in the province of Leinster, Ireland,
bounded N.E. by Carlingford Bay and Co. Down, E. by the
Irish Sea, S.W. by Meath, and N.W. by Monaghan and Armagh.
It is the smallest county in Ireland, its area being 202,731 acres
or about 317 sq. m. The greater part of the surface is undulating,
with occasionally lofty hills; in the north-east, on the borders
of Carlingford Lough, there is a mountain range approaching
2000 ft. in height. Many of the hills are finely wooded, and
towards the sea the scenery, in the more elevated districts, is
strikingly picturesque. With the exception of the promontory
of Clogher Head, which rises abruptly to a height of 180 ft.,
the coast is for the most part low and sandy. The narrow and
picturesque Carlingford Lough is navigable beyond the limits
of the county, and Carlingford and Greenore are well-known
watering-places on the county Louth shore. The Bay of Dundalk
stretches to the town of that name and affords convenient shelter.
The principal rivers, the Fane, the Lagan, the Glyde and the Dee,
flow eastwards. None of these is navigable, but the Boyne,
which forms the southern boundary of the county, is navigable
for large vessels as far as Drogheda.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Almost all this county is occupied by an undulating lowland of
much-folded Silurian shales and fine-grained sandstones; but
Carboniferous Limestone overlies these rocks north and east of
Dundalk. Dolerite and gabbro, in turn invaded by granite, have
broken through the limestone north of Dundalk Bay, and form a
striking and mountainous promontory. There is now no doubt
that these rocks, with those on the adjacent moorland of Slieve
Gullion, belong to the early Cainozoic igneous series, and may be
compared with similar masses in the Isle of Skye. A raised beach
provides a flat terrace at Greenore. Lead ore has been worked in
the county, as in the adjacent parts of Armagh and Monaghan.</p>

<p>In the lower regions the soil is a very rich deep mould, admirably
adapted both for cereals and green crops. The higher mountain
regions are covered principally with heath. Agriculture generally
is in an advanced condition, and the farms are for the most part well
drained. The acreage of tillage is but little below that of pasture.
Oats, barley, flax, potatoes and turnips are all satisfactorily cultivated.
Cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry represent the bulk of the
live stock. Linen manufactures are of some importance. The deep-sea
and coast fishery has its headquarters at Dundalk, and the salmon
fisheries at Dundalk (Castletown river) and Drogheda (river Boyne).
These fisheries, together with oyster beds in Carlingford Lough, are
of great value. The county is traversed from S. to N. by the Great
Northern railway, with a branch westward from Dundalk; while the
same town is connected with the port of Greenore by a line owned
by the London &amp; North-Western railway of England. From
Greenore the London &amp; North-Western railway passenger steamers
run regularly to Holyhead. The town of Ardee is served by a branch
from the Great Northern line at Dromin.</p>

<p>The population (71,914 in 1891; 65,820 in 1901) decreases at
about an average rate, and a considerable number of the inhabitants
emigrate. Of the total population about 92% are Roman Catholics.
The principal towns are Dundalk (pop. 13,076), Drogheda (12,760)
and Ardee (1883). The county includes six baronies and sixty-four
parishes. Assizes are held at Dundalk and quarter sessions at Ardee,
Drogheda and Dundalk. Louth was represented by two county and
ten borough members in the Irish parliament; the two present
divisions are the north and south, each returning one member. The
county is in the Protestant dioceses of Armagh and Clogher and the
Roman Catholic diocese of Armagh.</p>
</div>

<p>The territory which afterwards became the county Louth
was included in the principality of Uriel, Orgial or Argial, which
comprehended also the greater part of Meath, Monaghan and
Armagh. The chieftain of the district was conquered by John
de Courcy in 1183, and Louth or Uriel was among the shires
generally considered to have been created by King John, and
peopled by English settlers. Until the time of Elizabeth it
was included in the province of Ulster. County Louth is rich
in antiquarian remains. There are ancient buildings of all dates,
and spears, swords, axes of bronze, ornaments of gold, and other
relics have been discovered in quantities. Among Druidical
remains is the fine cromlech of Ballymascanlan, between Dundalk
and Greenore. Danish raths and other forts are numerous.
It is said that there were originally twenty religious houses in
the county. Of the remains of these the most interesting are at
Monasterboice and Mellifont, both near Drogheda. At the
former site are two churches, the larger dating probably from the
9th century, the smaller from the 13th; a fine round tower,
110 ft. in height, but not quite perfect; and three crosses, two
of which, 27 and 15 ft. in height respectively, are adorned with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
moulding, sculptured figures and tracery, and are among the
finest in Ireland. At Mellifont are the remains of the first
Cistercian monastery founded in Ireland, in 1142, with a massive
gatehouse, an octagonal baptistery and chapter-house. Carlingford
and Drogheda have monastic remains, and at Dromiskin is
a round tower, in part rebuilt. Ardee, an ancient town, incorporated
in 1376, has a castle of the 13th century. At Dunbar a
charter of Charles II. (1679) gave the inhabitants the right to
elect a sovereign. Louth, 5½ m. S.W. from Dundalk, is a decayed
town which gave its name to the county, and contains ruins of an
abbey to which was attached one of the most noted early schools
in Ireland.</p>

Lindsey or Louth parliamentary division of Lincolnshire,
England, on the river Lud, 141½ m. N. of London by the Grimsby
branch of the Great Northern railway. Pop. (1901) 9518.
By a canal, completed in 1763, there is water communication
with the Humber. The Perpendicular church of St James,
completed about 1515, with a spire 300 ft. in height, is one of the
finest ecclesiastical buildings in the county. Traces of a building
of the 13th century are perceptible. There are a town hall, a
corn exchange and a market-hall, an Edward VI. grammar
school, which is richly endowed, a commercial school founded
in 1676, a hospital and several almshouses. Thorpe Hall is a
picturesque building dated 1584. In the vicinity are the ruins
of a Cistercian abbey (Louth Park). The industries include
the manufacture of agricultural implements, iron-founding,
brewing, malting, and rope and brick-making. The town is
governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area,

record as a borough held, as it had been in Saxon times, by the
bishop of Lincoln, who had a market there. The see retained
the manor until it was surrendered by Bishop Holbeach to
Henry VIII., who granted it to Edward, earl of Lincoln, but it
was recovered by the Crown before 1562. Louth owed much of its
early prosperity to the adjacent Cistercian abbey of Louth Park,
founded in 1139 by Alexander bishop of Lincoln. The borough
was never more than prescriptive, though burgesses were
admitted throughout the middle ages and until 1711, their sole
privilege being freedom from tolls. The medieval government
of the town was by the manor court under the presidency of the
bishop&rsquo;s high steward, the custom being for the reeve to be
elected by eighteen ex-reeves. The original parish church was
built about 1170. During the 13th and 14th centuries nine
religious gilds were founded in the town. Fear of confiscation of
the property of these gilds seems to have been one of the chief
local causes of the Lincolnshire Rebellion, which broke out here
in 1536. The disturbance began by the parishioners seizing
the church ornaments to prevent their surrender. The bishop&rsquo;s
steward, who arrived to open the manorial court for the election
of a reeve, agreed to ride to ask the king the truth about the
jewels, but this did not satisfy the people, who, while showing
respect to a royal commission, seized and burnt the papers of the
bishop&rsquo;s registrar. After swearing several country gentlemen to
their cause, the rebels dispersed, agreeing to meet on the following
day under arms. Edward VI. in 1551 incorporated Louth under
one warden and six assistants, who were to be managers of the
school founded by the same charter. This was confirmed in 1564
by Elizabeth, who granted the manor of Louth to the corporation
with all rights and all the lands of the suppressed gilds at an
annual fee-farm rent of £84. James I. gave the commission of
the peace to the warden and one assistant in 1605; a further
charter was obtained in 1830. Louth has never been a parliamentary
borough. The markets said to have been held from
ancient times and the three fairs on the third Sunday after
Easter and the feasts of St Martin and St James were confirmed
in 1551. Louth was a seat of the wool trade as early as 1297; the
modern manufactures seem to have arisen at the end of the 18th
century, when, according to the charter of 1830, there was a great
increase in the population, manufactures, trade and commerce
of the town.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUVAIN<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (Flem. <i>Leuven</i>), a town of Belgium in the province
of Brabant, of which it was the capital in the 14th century
before the rise of Brussels. Pop. (1904) 42,194. Local tradition
attributes the establishment of a permanent camp at this spot
to Julius Caesar, but Louvain only became important in the
11th century as a place of residence for the dukes of Brabant.
In 1356 Louvain was the scene of the famous <i>Joyeuse Entrée</i>
of Wenceslas which represented the principal charter of Brabant.
At that time it had a population of at least 50,000 and was very
prosperous as the centre of the woollen trade in central Belgium.
The gild of weavers numbered 2400 members. The old walls
of Louvain were 4½ m. in circumference, and have been replaced
by boulevards, but within them there is a considerable extent of
cultivated ground. Soon after the <i>Joyeuse Entrée</i> a serious feud
began between the citizens and the patrician class, and eventually
the duke threw in his lot with the latter. After a struggle of
over twenty years&rsquo; duration the White Hoods, as the citizens
called themselves, were crushed. In 1379 they massacred
seventeen nobles in the town hall, but this crime brought down
on them the vengeance of the duke, to whom in 1383 they made
the most abject and complete surrender. With this civil strife the
importance and prosperity of Louvain declined. Many weavers
fled to Holland and England, the duke took up his residence in the
strong castle of Vilvorde, and Brussels prospered at the expense
of Louvain. What it lost in trade it partially recovered as a seat
of learning, for in 1423, Duke John IV. of Brabant founded there
a university and ever since Louvain University has enjoyed the
first place in Belgium. It has always prided itself most on its
theological teaching. In 1679 the university was established in
the old Cloth Workers&rsquo; Hall, a building dating from 1317, with
long arcades and graceful pillars supporting the upper storeys.
The library contains 70,000 volumes and some 500 manuscripts.
Attached to the university are four residential colleges at which
the number of students average two thousand. In the 16th
century when the university was at the height of its fame it
counted six thousand.</p>

<p>The most remarkable building in Louvain is the Hôtel de
Ville, one of the richest and most ornate examples of pointed
Gothic in the country. If less ornate than that of Oudenarde
it is more harmonious in its details. It was the work of Mathieu
de Layens, master mason, who worked at it from 1448 to 1463.
The building is one of three storeys each with ten pointed
windows forming the façade facing the square. Above is a
graceful balustrade behind which is a lofty roof, and at the
angles are towers perforated for the passage of the light. The
other three sides are lavishly decorated with statuary. The
interior is not noteworthy.</p>

<p>Opposite the Hôtel de Ville is the fine church of St Pierre,
in the form of a cross with a low tower to which the spire
has never been added. The existing edifice was built on the
site of an older church between 1425 and 1497. It contains
seven chapels, in two of which are fine pictures by Dierich Bouts
formerly attributed to Memling. Much of the iron and brass
work is by Jean Matseys. There is also an ancient tomb, being
the monument of Henry I., duke of Brabant, who died in
1235. There are four other interesting churches in Louvain,
viz. Ste Gertrude, St Quentin, St Michael and St Jacques.
In the last-named is a fine De Crayer representing St Hubert.
Some ruins on a hill exist of the old castle of the counts of
Louvain whose title was merged in the higher style of the dukes
of Brabant.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The word has been derived from the French <i>l&rsquo;ouvert</i>, the &ldquo;open&rdquo;
space. This, Minsheu&rsquo;s guess, is now generally abandoned. The
Old French form, of which the English is an adaptation, was <i>lover</i>
or <i>lovier</i>. The medieval Latin <i>lodium</i>, <i>lodarium</i>, is suggested as the
ultimate origin. Du Cange (<i>Glossarium</i>, s.v. &ldquo;lodia&rdquo;) defines it as
<i>lugurium</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a small hut. The English form &ldquo;louvre&rdquo; is due to a
confusion with the name of the palace in Paris. The origin of that
name is also unknown; <i>louverie</i>, place of wolves, is one of the
suggestions, the palace being supposed to have originally been a
hunting-box (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paris</a></span>).</p>

Provence, occupied the position of president of the Chambre des

went to Paris with Louis II. of Anjou, king of Sicily, attached
himself to the dauphin Charles, and after having been chief
steward of the household to Queen Isabella he turned against her.
He was one of the principal agents of the Armagnac party, and
became the most influential adviser of Charles VII. during the
first years of his reign. But his rapacity gained him enemies,

<p><span class="bold">LOUVET DE COUVRAI, JEAN BAPTISTE<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1760-1797),
French writer and politician, was born in Paris on the 12th of
June 1760, the son of a stationer. He became a bookseller&rsquo;s
clerk, and first attracted attention with a not very moral novel
called <i>Les Amours du chevalier de Faublas</i> (Paris, 1787-1789).
The character of the heroine of this book, Lodoïska, was taken
from the wife of a jeweller in the Palais Royal, with whom he
had formed a <i>liaison</i>. She was divorced from her husband in
1792 and married Louvet in 1793. His second novel, <i>Émilie
de Varmont</i>, was intended to prove the utility and necessity
of divorce and of the marriage of priests, questions raised by
the Revolution. Indeed all his works were directed to the ends
of the Revolution. He attempted to have one of his unpublished
plays, <i>L&rsquo;Anobli conspirateur</i>, performed at the Théâtre Français,
and records naïvely that one of its managers, M. d&rsquo;Orfeuil,
listened to the reading of the first three acts &ldquo;with mortal
impatience,&rdquo; exclaiming at last: &ldquo;I should need cannon in
order to put that piece on the stage.&rdquo; A &ldquo;sort of farce&rdquo; at the
expense of the army of the <i>émigrés, La Grande Revue des armées
noire el blanche</i>, had, however, better success: it ran for twenty-five
nights.</p>

<p>Louvet was, however, first brought into notice as a politician
by his <i>Paris justifié</i>, in reply to a &ldquo;truly incendiary&rdquo; pamphlet
in which Mounier, after the removal of the king to Paris in
October 1789, had attacked the capital, &ldquo;at that time blameless,&rdquo;
and argued that the court should be established elsewhere.
This led to Louvet&rsquo;s election to the Jacobin Club, for which, as he
writes bitterly in his Memoirs, the qualifications were then
&ldquo;a genuine <i>civisme</i> and some talent.&rdquo; A self-styled <i>philosophe</i>
of the true revolutionary type, he now threw himself ardently
into the campaign against &ldquo;despotism&rdquo; and &ldquo;reaction,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
against the moderate constitutional royalty advocated by
Lafayette, the Abbé Maury and other &ldquo;Machiavellians.&rdquo; On
the 25th of December 1791 he presented at the bar of the
Assembly his <i>Pétition contre les princes</i>, which had &ldquo;a prodigious
success in the senate and the empire.&rdquo; Elected deputy to
the Assembly for the department of Loiret, he made his first
speech in January 1792. He attached himself to the Girondists,
whose vague deism, sentimental humanitarianism and ardent
republicanism he fully shared, and from March to November
1792 he published, at Roland&rsquo;s expense, a bi-weekly <i>journal-affiche</i>,
of which the title, <i>La Sentinelle</i>, proclaimed its mission
to be to &ldquo;enlighten the people on all the plots&rdquo; at a time when,
Austria having declared war, the court was &ldquo;visibly betraying
our armies.&rdquo; On the 10th of August he became editor of the
<i>Journal des débats</i>, and in this capacity, as well as in the Assembly,
made himself conspicuous by his attacks on Robespierre, Marat
and the other Montagnards, whom he declares he would have
succeeded in bringing to justice in September but for the poor
support he received from the Girondist leaders. It is more
probable, however, that his ill-balanced invective contributed
to their ruin and his own; for him Robespierre was a &ldquo;royalist,&rdquo;
Marat &ldquo;the principal agent of England,&rdquo; the Montagnards
Orleanists in masquerade. His courageous attitude at the
trial of Louis XVI., when he supported the &ldquo;appeal to the
people,&rdquo; only served still further to discredit the Girondists.
He defended them, however, to the last with great courage, if
with little discretion; and after the crisis of the 31st of May
1793 he shared the perils of the party who fled from Paris (see
Girondists). His wife, &ldquo;Lodoïska,&rdquo; who had actively cooperated
in his propaganda, was also in danger.</p>

<p>After the fall of Robespierre, he was recalled to the Convention,
when he was instrumental in bringing Carrier and the others
responsible for the <i>Noyades</i> of Nantes to justice. His influence
was now considerable; he was elected a member of the Committee
of the Constitution, president of the Assembly, and member of
the Committee of Public Safety, against the overgrown power
of which he had in earlier days protested. His hatred of the
Mountain had not made him reactionary; he was soon regarded
as one of the mainstays of the &ldquo;Jacobins,&rdquo; and <i>La Sentinelle</i>
reappeared, under his auspices, preaching union among republicans.
Under the Directory (1795) he was elected a member
of the Council of Five Hundred, of which he was secretary, and
also a member of the Institute. Meanwhile he had returned to
his old trade and set up a bookseller&rsquo;s shop in the Palais Royal.
But, in spite of the fact that he had once more denounced the
Jacobins in <i>La Sentinelle</i>, his name had become identified with
all that the combative spirits of the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> most disliked;
his shop was attacked by the &ldquo;young men&rdquo; with cries of
&ldquo;<i>À bas la Loupe, à bas la belle Lodoïska, à bas les gardes du corps
de Louvet!</i>&rdquo; he and his wife were insulted in the streets and the
theatres: &ldquo;<i>À bas les Louvets et les Louvetants!</i>&rdquo; and he was
compelled to leave Paris. The Directory appointed him to the
consulship at Palermo, but he died on the 25th of August 1797
before taking up his post.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1795 Louvet published a portion of his Memoirs under the title
of <i>Quelques notices pour l&rsquo;histoire et le récit de mes périls depuis le 31
mai 1793</i>. They were mainly written in the various hiding-places
in which Louvet <span class="correction" title="amended from rook">took</span> refuge, and they give a vivid picture of the
sufferings of the proscribed Girondists. They form an invaluable
document for the study of the psychology of the Revolution; for
in spite of their considerable literary art, they are artless in their
revelation of the mental and moral state of their author, a characteristic
type of the honest, sentimental, somewhat hysterical and wholly
unbalanced minds nurtured on the abstractions of the <i>philosophes</i>.
The first complete edition of the <i>Mémoires de Louvet de Couvrai</i>,
edited, with preface, notes and tables, by F. A. Aulard, was published
at Paris in 1889.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUVIERS,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> a town of north-western France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Eure, 17½ m. S.S.E. of
Rouen by road. Pop. (1906) 9449. Louviers is pleasantly situated
in a green valley surrounded by wooded hills, on the Eure, which
here divides into several branches. The old part of the town,
built of wood, stands on the left bank of the river; the more
modern portions, in brick and hewn stone, on the right. There
are spacious squares, and the place is surrounded by boulevards.
The Gothic church of Notre-Dame has a south portal which
ranks among the most beautiful works of the kind produced
in the 15th century; it contains fine stained glass of the 15th
and 16th centuries and other works of art. The hôtel-de-ville,
a large modern building, contains a museum and library. The
chief industry is cloth and flannel manufacture. There are
wool-spinning and fulling mills, thread factories and manufactories
of spinning and weaving machinery, and enamel ware;
leather-working, dyeing, metal-founding and bell-founding
are also carried on. The town is the seat of a sub-prefect and
has a court of first instance, a tribunal of commerce, a chamber
of arts and manufactures, and a council of trade arbitrators.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Louviers (<i>Lovera</i>) was originally a <i>villa</i> of the dukes of Normandy
and in the middle ages belonged to the archbishops of Rouen; its
cloth-making industry first arose in the beginning of the 13th
century. It changed hands once and again during the Hundred
Years&rsquo; War, and from Charles VII. it received extensive privileges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
and the title of Louviers le Franc for the bravery of its inhabitants
in driving the English from Pont de l&rsquo;Arche, Verneuil and Harcourt.
It passed through various troubles successively at the period of the
League of the Public Weal under Louis XI., in the religious wars
(when the parlement of Rouen sat for a time at Louviers) and in the
wars of the Fronde.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOUVOIS, FRANÇOIS MICHEL LE TELLIER,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> <span class="sc">Marquis de</span>
(1641-1691), French statesman, war minister of Louis XIV.,
was born at Paris on the 18th of January 1641. His father,
Michel le Tellier (<i>q.v.</i>), married him to an heiress, the marquise
de Courtenvaux, and instructed him in the management of state
business. The young man won the king&rsquo;s confidence, and in 1666
he succeeded his father as war minister. His talents were perceived
by Turenne in the war of Devolution (1667-68), who gave
him instruction in the art of providing armies. After the peace
of Aix-la-Chapelle, Louvois devoted himself to organizing the
French army. The years between 1668 and 1672, says Camille
Rousset, &ldquo;were years of preparation, when Lionne was labouring
with all his might to find allies, Colbert to find money, and
Louvois soldiers for Louis.&rdquo; The work of Louvois in these years
is bound up with the historical development of the French army
and of armies in general (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Army</a></span>). Here need only be mentioned
Louvois&rsquo;s reorganization of the military orders of merit,
his foundation of the Hôtel des Invalides, and the almost forcible
enrolment of the nobility and gentry of France, in which Louvois
carried out part of Louis&rsquo;s measures for curbing the spirit of
independence by service in the army or at court. The success
of his measures is to be seen in the victories of the great war of
1672-78. After the peace of Nijmwegen Louvois was high in
favour, his father had been made chancellor, and the influence of
Colbert was waning. The ten years of peace between 1678 and
1688 were distinguished in French history by the rise of Madame
de Maintenon, the capture of Strassburg and the revocation of
the Edict of Nantes, in all of which Louvois bore a prominent
part. The surprise of Strassburg in 1681 in time of peace was not
only planned but executed by Louvois and Monclar. A saving
clause in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which provided
for some liberty of conscience, if not of worship, Louvois sharply
annulled with the phrase &ldquo;Sa majesté veut qu&rsquo;on fasse sentir
les dernières rigueurs à ceux qui ne voudront pas se faire de sa
religion.&rdquo; He claimed also the credit of inventing the dragonnades,
and mitigated the rigour of the soldiery only in so far as
the licence accorded was prejudicial to discipline. Discipline,
indeed, and complete subjection to the royal authority was the
political faith of Louvois. Colbert died in 1683, and had been
replaced by Le Pelletier, an adherent of Louvois, in the controller-generalship
of finances, and by Louvois himself in his ministry
for public buildings, which he took that he might be the minister
able to gratify the king&rsquo;s two favourite pastimes, war and building.
Louvois was able to superintend the successes of the first
years of the war of the League of Augsburg, but died suddenly of
apoplexy after leaving the king&rsquo;s cabinet on July 16, 1691.
His sudden death caused a suspicion of poison. Louvois was one
of the greatest of the rare class of great war ministers. French
history can only point to Carnot as his equal. Both had to
organize armies out of old material on a new system, both were
admirable contrivers of campaigns, and both devoted themselves
to the material well-being of the soldiers. In private life and
in the means employed for gaining his ends, Louvois was unscrupulous
and shameless.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principal authority for Louvois&rsquo;s life and times is Camille
Rousset&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de Louvois</i> (Paris, 1872), a great work founded
on the 900 volumes of his despatches at the Depôt de la Guerre.
Saint Simon from his class prejudices is hardly to be trusted, but
Madame de Sévigné throws many side-lights on his times. <i>Testament
politique de Louvois</i> (1695) is spurious.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOU&#376;S, PIERRE<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1870-&emsp;&emsp;), French novelist and poet, was
born in Paris on the 10th of December 1870. When he was
nineteen he founded a review, <i>La Conque</i>, which brought him
into contact with the leaders of the Parnassians, and counted
Swinburne, Maeterlinck, Mallarmé and others among its contributors.
He won notoriety by his novel <i>Aphrodite</i> (1896),
which gave a vivid picture of Alexandrian morals at the
beginning of the Christian era. His <i>Chansons de Bilitis, roman
lyrique</i> (1894), which purported to be a translation from the
Greek, is a glorification of Sapphic love, which in subject-matter
is objectionable in the highest degree; but its delicate decadent
prose is typical of a modern French literary school, and some
of the &ldquo;songs&rdquo; were set to music by Debussy and others. Later
books are: <i>La Femme et le pantin</i> (1898); <i>Les Aventures du roi
Pausole</i> (1900); <i>Sanguines</i> (1903); <i>Archipel</i> (1906). Louÿs
married in 1899 Louise de Heredia, younger daughter of the poet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOVAT, SIMON FRASER,<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> <span class="sc">12th Baron</span> (<i>c</i>. 1667-1747), Scottish
chief and Jacobite intriguer, was born about 1667 and was the
second son of Thomas Fraser, third son of the 8th Lord Lovat.
The barony of Lovat dates from about 1460, in the person of
Hugh Fraser, a descendant of Simon Fraser (killed at Halidon
Hill in 1338) who acquired the tower and fort of Lovat near
Beauly, Inverness-shire, and from whom the clan Fraser was
called &ldquo;Macshimi&rdquo; (sons of Simon). Young Simon was educated
at King&rsquo;s College, Aberdeen, and his correspondence afterwards
gives proof, not only of a command of good English and idiomatic
French, but of such an acquaintance with the Latin classics as
to leave him never at a loss for an apt quotation from Virgil or
Horace. Whether Lovat ever felt any real loyalty to the Stuarts
or was actuated by self-interest it is difficult to determine, but
that he was a born traitor and deceiver there can be no doubt.
One of his first acts on leaving college was to recruit three hundred
men from his clan to form part of a regiment in the service of
William and Mary, in which he himself was to hold a command,&mdash;his
object being to have a body of well-trained soldiers under his
influence, whom at a moment&rsquo;s notice he might carry over to
the interest of King James. Among other outrages in which he
was engaged about this time was a rape and forced marriage
committed on the widow of the 10th Lord Lovat with the view
apparently of securing his own succession to the estates; and it
is a curious instance of influence that, after being subjected by
him to horrible ill-usage, she is said to have become seriously
attached to him. A prosecution, however, having been instituted
against him by Lady Lovat&rsquo;s family, Simon retired first to his
native strongholds in the Highlands, and afterwards to France,
where he found his way in July 1702 to the court of St Germain.
In 1699, on his father&rsquo;s death, he assumed the title of Lord Lovat.
One of his first steps towards gaining influence in France seems
to have been to announce his conversion to the Catholic faith.
He then proceeded to put the project of restoring the exiled
family into a practical shape. Hitherto nothing seems to have
been known among the Jacobite exiles of the efficiency of the
Highlanders as a military force. But Lovat saw that, as they
were the only part of the British population accustomed to the
independent use of arms, they could be at once put in action
against the reigning power. His plan therefore was to land
five thousand French troops at Dundee, where they might reach
the north-eastern passes of the Highlands in a day&rsquo;s march, and
be in a position to divert the British troops till the Highlands
should have time to rise. Immediately afterwards five hundred
men were to land on the west coast, seize Fort William or Inverlochy,
and thus prevent the access of any military force from the
south to the central Highlands. The whole scheme indicates
Lovat&rsquo;s sagacity as a military strategist, and his plan was
continuously kept in view in all future attempts of the Jacobites,
and finally acted on in the outbreak of 1745. The advisers of
the Pretender seem to have been either slow to trust their
coadjutor or to comprehend his project. At last, however,
he was despatched (1703) on a secret mission to the Highlands to
sound those of the chiefs who were likely to rise, and to ascertain
what forces they could bring into the field. He found, however,
that there was little disposition to join the rebellion, and he
then apparently made up his mind to secure his own safety by
revealing all that he knew to the government of Queen Anne.
He persuaded the duke of Queensberry that his rival, the duke
of Atholl, was in the Jacobite plot, and that if Queensberry
supported him he could obtain evidence of this at St Germain.
Queensberry foolishly entered into the intrigue with him against
Atholl, but when Lovat had gone to France with a pass from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
Queensberry the affair was betrayed to Atholl by Robert
Ferguson, and resulted in Queensberry&rsquo;s discomfiture. The
story is obscure, and is complicated by partisanship on either
side; but Lovat was certainly playing a double game. His
agility, however, was not remunerative. On returning to Paris
suspicions got afloat as to Lovat&rsquo;s proceedings, and he was
imprisoned in the castle of Angoulême. He remained nearly
ten years under supervision, till in November 1714 he made
his escape to England. For some twenty-five years after this
he was chiefly occupied in lawsuits for the recovery of his estates
and the re-establishment of his fortune, in both of which objects
he was successful. The intervals of his leisure were filled up by
Jacobite and Anti-Jacobite intrigues, in which he seems to have
alternately, as suited his interests, acted the traitor to both
parties. But he so far obtained the confidence of the government
as to secure the appointments of sheriff of Inverness and of colonel
of an independent company. His disloyal practices, however,
soon led to his being suspected; and he was deprived of both his
appointments. When the rebellion of 1745 broke out, Lovat
acted with characteristic duplicity. He represented to the
Jacobites&mdash;what was probably in the main true&mdash;that though
eager for their success his weak health and advanced years
prevented him from joining the standard of the prince in person,
while to the Lord President Forbes he professed his cordial
attachment to the existing state of things, but lamented that his
son, in spite of all his remonstrances, had joined the Pretender,
and succeeded in taking with him a strong force from the clan
of the Frasers. The truth was that the lad was unwilling to go,
but was compelled by his father. Lovat&rsquo;s false professions of
fidelity did not long deceive the government, and after the
battle of Culloden he was obliged to retreat to the Highlands,
after seeing from a distant height his castle of Dounie burnt by
the royal army. Even then, broken down by disease and old age,
carried on a litter and unable to move without assistance, his
mental resources did not fail; and in a conference with several
of the Jacobite leaders he proposed that they should raise a body
of three thousand men, which would be enough to make their
mountains impregnable, and at length force the government to
give them advantageous terms. The project was not carried out,
and Lovat, after enduring incredible hardships in his wanderings,
was at last arrested on an island in Loch Morar. He was conveyed
in a litter to London, and after a trial of five days sentence of
death was pronounced on the 19th of March 1747. His execution
took place on the 9th of April. His conduct to the last was
dignified and even cheerful. Just before submitting his head to
the block he repeated the line from Horace&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His son <span class="sc">Simon Fraser</span>, Master of Lovat (1726-1782) (not to
be confused with another Simon Fraser who saw somewhat
similar service and was killed in 1777 at the battle of Saratoga),
was a soldier, who at the beginning of the Seven Years&rsquo; War
raised a corps of Fraser Highlanders for the English service,
and at the outbreak of the American War of Independence raised
another regiment which took a prominent part in it. He fought
under Wolfe in Canada, and also in Portugal, and rose to be a
British major-general. The family estates were restored to him,
but the title was not revived till 1837. On his death without
issue, and also of his successor, his half-brother Archibald
Campbell Fraser (1736-1815), the Lovat estates passed to the
Frasers of Strichen, Aberdeenshire. The 16th Baron Lovat
(b. 1871) raised a corps of mounted infantry (Lovat&rsquo;s Scouts)
in the Boer war of 1899-1902.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOVE-BIRD,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> a name somewhat indefinitely bestowed, chiefly
by dealers and their customers, on some of the smaller short-tailed
parrots, from the affection which examples of opposite sexes
exhibit towards each other. By many ornithologists the birds
thus named, brought almost entirely from Africa and South
America, have been retained in a single genus, <i>Psittacula</i>, though
those belonging to the former country were by others separated
as <i>Agapornis</i>. This separation, however, was neither generally
approved nor easily justified, until Garrod (<i>Proc. Zool. Society</i>,
1874, p. 593) assigned good anatomical ground, afforded by the
structure of the carotid artery, for regarding the two groups
as distinct, and thus removed the puzzle presented by the
geographical distribution of the species of <i>Psittacula</i> in a large
sense, though Huxley (<i>op. cit.</i> 1868, p. 319) had suggested one
way of meeting the difficulty. As the genus is now restricted,
only one of the six species of <i>Psittacula</i> enumerated in the
<i>Nomenclator Avium</i> of Sclater and Salvin is known to be found
outside the Neotropical Region, the exception being the Mexican
<i>P. cyanopygia</i>, and not one of the seven recognized by the same
authors as forming the nearly allied genus <i>Urochroma</i>. On the
other hand, of <i>Agapornis</i>, from which the so-called genus <i>Poliopsitta</i>
can scarcely be separated, five if not six species are known,
all belonging to the Ethiopian Region, and all but one, <i>A. cana</i>
(which is indigenous to Madagascar, and thence has been widely
disseminated), are natives of Africa. In this group probably
comes also <i>Psittinus</i>, with a single species from the Malayan
Subregion. One of the birds most commonly called love-birds,
but with no near relationship to any of the above, being a long-tailed
though very small parrot, is the budgerigar (<i>Melopsittacus
undulatus</i>) now more familiar in Europe than most native birds,
as it is used to &ldquo;tell fortunes&rdquo; in the streets, and is bred by
hundreds in aviaries. Its native country is Australia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOVEDALE,<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> a mission station in the Victoria East division
of the Cape province, South Africa. It lies 1720 ft. above the
sea on the banks of the Tyumie (Chumie) tributary of the
Keiskama river, some 2 m. N. of Alice, a town 88 m. N.W. by
rail of East London. The station was founded in 1824 by the
Glasgow Missionary Society and was named after Dr John Love,
one of the leading members of, and at the time secretary to, the
society. The site first chosen was in the Ncera valley. But in
1834 the mission buildings were destroyed by the Kaffirs.
On rebuilding, the station was removed somewhat farther
north to the banks of the Tyumie. In 1846 the work at Lovedale
was again interrupted, this time by the War of the Axe (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cape Colony</a></span>: <i>History</i>). On this occasion the buildings were
converted into a fort and garrisoned by regular troops. Once
more, in 1850, the Kaffirs threatened Lovedale and made an
attack on the neighbouring Fort Hare,<a name="fa1t" id="fa1t" href="#ft1t"><span class="sp">1</span></a> built during the previous
war.</p>

<p>Until 1841 the missionaries had devoted themselves almost
entirely to evangelistic work; in that year the Lovedale
Missionary Institute was founded by the Rev. W. Govan, who,
save for brief intervals, continued at its head until 1870. He
was then succeeded by the Rev. James Stewart (1831-1905), who
had joined the mission in 1867, having previously (1861-1863),
and partly in company with David Livingstone, explored the
Zambezi regions. To Stewart, who remained at the head of the
institute till his death, is due the existing organization at Lovedale.
The institute, in addition to its purely church work&mdash;in
which no sectarian tests are allowed&mdash;provides for the education
of natives of both sexes in nearly all branches of learning (Stewart
discontinued the teaching of Greek and Latin, adopting English
as the classic); it also takes European scholars, no colour distinction
being allowed in any department of the work. The
institute gives technical training in many subjects and maintains
various industries, including such diverse enterprises as farming
and printing-works. It also maintains a hospital. The school
buildings rival in accommodation and completeness those of
the schools in large English cities. The sum paid in fees by
scholars (of whom fully nine-tenths were Kaffirs) in the period
1841-1908 was £84,000. The educational and industrial methods
initiated at Lovedale have been widely adopted by other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
missionary bodies. Lovedale is now a branch o£ the work of
the United Free Church of Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOVELACE, RICHARD<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1618-1658), English poet, was born
at Woolwich in 1618. He was a scion of a Kentish family,
and inherited a tradition of military distinction, maintained
by successive generations from the time of Edward III. His
father, Sir William Lovelace, had served in the Low Countries,
received the honour of knighthood from James I., and was killed
at Grolle in 1628. His brother, Francis Lovelace, the &ldquo;Colonel
Francis&rdquo; of <i>Lucasta</i>, served on the side of Charles I., and defended
Caermarthen in 1644. His mother&rsquo;s family was legal;
her grandfather had been chief baron of the exchequer. Richard
was educated at the Charterhouse and at Gloucester Hall,
Oxford, where he matriculated in 1634. Through the request
of one of the queen&rsquo;s ladies on the royal visit to Oxford he was
made M.A., though only in his second year at the university.
Lovelace&rsquo;s fame has been kept alive by a few songs and the
romance of his career, and his poems are commonly spoken
of as careless improvisations, and merely the amusements of an
active soldier. But the unhappy course of his life gave him
more leisure for verse-making than opportunity of soldiering.
Before the outbreak of the civil war in 1642 his only active
service was in the bloodless expedition which ended in the
Pacification of Berwick in 1640. On the conclusion of peace he
entered into possession of the family estates at Bethersden,
Canterbury, Chart and Halden in Kent. By that time he was
one of the most distinguished of the company of courtly poets
gathered round Queen Henrietta, who were influenced as a school
by contemporary French writers of <i>vers de société</i>. He wrote a
comedy, <i>The Scholar</i>, when he was sixteen, and a tragedy,
<i>The Soldier</i>, when he was twenty-one. From what he says of
Fletcher, it would seem that this dramatist was his model, but
only the prologue and epilogue to his comedy have been preserved.
When the rupture between king and parliament took place,
Lovelace was committed to the Gatehouse at Westminster for
presenting to the Commons in 1642 a petition from Kentish
royalists in the king&rsquo;s favour. It was then that he wrote his
most famous song, &ldquo;To Althea from Prison.&rdquo; He was liberated,
says Wood, on bail of £40,000 (more probably £4000), and
throughout the civil war was a prisoner on parole, with this
security in the hands of his enemies. He contrived, however,
to render considerable service to the king&rsquo;s cause. He provided
his two brothers with money to raise men for the Royalist army,
and befriended many of the king&rsquo;s adherents. He was especially
generous to scholars and musicians, and among his associates in
London were Henry Lawes and John Gamble, the Cottons, Sir
Peter Lely, Andrew Marvell and probably Sir John Suckling.
He joined the king at Oxford in 1645, and after the surrender
of the city in 1646 he raised a regiment for the service of the
French king. He was wounded at the siege of Dunkirk, and with
his brother Dudley, who had acted as captain in his brother&rsquo;s
command, returned to England in 1648. It is not known
whether the brothers took any part in the disturbances in Kent
of that year, but both were imprisoned at Petre House in Aldersgate.
During this second imprisonment he collected and revised
for the press a volume of occasional poems, many if not most of
which had previously appeared in various publications. The
volume was published in 1649 under the title of <i>Lucasta</i>, his
poetical name&mdash;contracted from <i>Lux Casta</i>&mdash;for a lady rashly
identified by Wood as Lucy Sacheverell, who, it is said, married
another during his absence in France, on a report that he had
died of his wounds at Dunkirk. The last ten years of Lovelace&rsquo;s
life were passed in obscurity. His fortune had been exhausted
in the king&rsquo;s interest, and he is said to have been supported by
the generosity of friends. He died in 1658 &ldquo;in a cellar in Longacre,&rdquo;
according to Aubrey, who, however, possibly exaggerates
his poverty. A volume of Lovelace&rsquo;s <i>Posthume Poems</i> was
published in 1659 by his brother Dudley. They are of inferior
merit to his own collection.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The world has done no injustice to Lovelace in neglecting all but
a few of his modest offerings to literature. But critics often do him
injustice in dismissing him as a gay cavalier, who dashed off his
verses hastily and cared little what became of them. It is a mistake
to class him with Suckling; he has neither Suckling&rsquo;s easy grace
nor his reckless spontaneity. We have only to compare the version
of any of his poems in <i>Lucasta</i> with the form in which it originally
appeared to see how fastidious was his revision. In many places it
takes time to decipher his meaning. The expression is often elliptical,
the syntax inverted and tortuous, the train of thought intricate and
discontinuous. These faults&mdash;they are not of course to be found in
his two or three popular lyrics, &ldquo;Going to the Wars,&rdquo; &ldquo;To Althea
from Prison,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Scrutiny&rdquo;&mdash;are, however, as in the case of his
poetical master, Donne, the faults not of haste but of over-elaboration.
His thoughts are not the first thoughts of an improvisatore,
but thoughts ten or twenty stages removed from the first, and they
are generally as closely packed as they are far-fetched.</p>

<p>His poems were edited by W. C. Hazlitt in 1864.</p>

a young man he served under Richard of Gloucester in the
expedition to Scotland in 1480. After the death of Edward
IV. he became one of his patron&rsquo;s strongest supporters. He
had been created a viscount on the 4th of January 1483, and
whilst still Protector Richard made him Chief Butler. As soon
as Richard became king, Lovell was promoted to be Lord
Chamberlain. Lovell helped in the suppression of Buckingham&rsquo;s
rebellion, and as one of Richard&rsquo;s most trusted ministers was
gibbeted in Collingbourne&rsquo;s couplet with Catesby and Ratcliffe:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">He had command of the fleet which was to have stopped Henry
Tudor&rsquo;s landing in 1485, but fought for Richard at Bosworth
and after the battle fled to sanctuary at Colchester. Thence
he escaped next year to organize a dangerous revolt in Yorkshire.
When that failed he fled to Margaret of Burgundy in
Flanders. As a chief leader of the Yorkist party he had a
foremost part in Lambert Simnel&rsquo;s enterprise. With John de
la Pole, earl of Lincoln, he accompanied the pretender to Ireland
and fought for him at Stoke on the 16th of June 1487. He was
seen escaping from the battle, but was never afterwards heard
of; Bacon relates that according to one report he lived long
after in a cave or vault (<i>Henry VII.</i>, p. 37, ed. Lumby). More
than 200 years later, in 1708, the skeleton of a man was found in
a secret chamber in the family mansion at Minster Lovell in
Oxfordshire. It is supposed that Francis Lovell had hidden
himself there and died of starvation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOVER, SAMUEL<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (1797-1868), Irish novelist, artist, songwriter
and musician, was born in Dublin on the 24th of February
1797. His father was a stockbroker. Lover began life as an
artist, and was elected in 1828 a member of the Royal Hibernian
Academy&mdash;a body of which two years afterwards he became
secretary. He acquired repute as a miniature painter, and a
number of the local aristocracy sat to him for their portraits.
His love for music showed itself at an early age. At a dinner
given to the poet Tom Moore in 1818 Lover sang one of his own
songs, which elicited special praise from Moore. One of his best-known
portraits was that of Paganini, which was exhibited at
the Royal Academy. He attracted attention as an author by
his <i>Legends and Stories of Ireland</i> (1832), and was one of the first
writers for the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>. He went to London
about 1835, where, among others, he painted Lord Brougham
in his robes as lord chancellor. His gifts rendered him popular
in society; and he appeared often at Lady Blessington&rsquo;s evening
receptions. There he sang several of his songs, which were
so well received that he published them (<i>Songs and Ballads</i>,
1839). Some of them illustrated Irish superstitions, among
these being &ldquo;Rory O&rsquo;More,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Angel&rsquo;s Whisper,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
May Dew&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Four-leaved Shamrock.&rdquo; In 1837 appeared
<i>Rory O&rsquo;More, a National Romance</i>, which at once made him a
reputation as a novelist; he afterwards dramatized it for the
Adelphi Theatre, London. In 1842 was published his best-known
work, <i>Handy Andy, an Irish Tale</i>. Meanwhile his pursuits had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
affected his health; and in 1844 he gave up writing for some
time, substituting instead public entertainments, called by him
&ldquo;Irish Evenings,&rdquo; illustrative of his own works. These were
successful both in Great Britain and in America. In addition
to publishing numerous songs of his own, Lover edited a collection
entitled <i>The Lyrics of Ireland</i>, which appeared in 1858.
He died on the 6th of July 1868. Besides the novels already
mentioned he wrote <i>Treasure Trove</i> (1844), and <i>Metrical Tales
and Other Poems</i> (1860).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOW, SETH<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (1850-&emsp;&emsp;), American administrator and educationist,
was born in Brooklyn, New York, on the 18th
of January 1850. He studied in the Polytechnic Institute of
Brooklyn and in Columbia University, where he graduated in
1870. He became a clerk (1870) and then a partner (1875) in
his father&rsquo;s tea and silk-importing house, A. A. Low &amp; Brothers,
which went out of business in 1888. In 1878 he organized, and
became president of, the Brooklyn Bureau of Charities. In
1882-1886 he was mayor of the city of Brooklyn, being twice
elected on an independent ticket; and by his administration of
his office he demonstrated that a rigid &ldquo;merit&rdquo; civil-service
system was practicable&mdash;in September 1884 the first municipal
civil-service rules in the United Service were adopted in Brooklyn.
He was president of Columbia University from 1890 to 1901,
and did much for it by his business administration, his liberality
(he gave $1,000,000 for the erection of a library) and his especial
interest in the department of Political Science. In his term
Columbia became a well-organized and closely-knit university.
Its official name was changed from Columbia College to Columbia
University. It was removed to a new site on Morningside
Heights, New York City. The New York College for the Training
of Teachers became its Teachers&rsquo; College of Columbia; a Faculty
of Pure Science was added; the Medical School gave up its
separate charter to become an integral part of the university;
Barnard College became more closely allied with the university;
relations were entered into between the university and the
General, Union and Jewish theological seminaries of New York
City and with Cooper Union, the Metropolitan Museum of Fine
Arts and the American Museum of Natural History; and its
faculty and student body became less local in character. Dr
Low was a delegate to the Hague Peace Conference in 1899. He
was prominent among those who brought about the chartering
of Greater New York in 1897, and in this year was an unsuccessful
candidate, on an independent ticket, for mayor of New York
City; in 1900, on a fusion ticket, he was elected mayor and
served in 1901-1903.</p>

In 1873 he entered the atelier of J. L. Gérôme in the École des
Beaux Arts at Paris, subsequently joining the classes of Carolus-Duran,
with whom he remained until 1877. Returning to New
York, he became a member of the Society of American Artists
in 1878 and of the National Academy of Design in 1890. His
pictures of New England types, and illustrations of Keats, brought
him into prominence. Subsequently he turned his attention to
decoration, and executed panels and medallions for the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, New York, a panel for the Essex County Court
House, Newark, New Jersey, panels for private residences and
stained-glass windows for various churches, including St Paul&rsquo;s
Methodist Episcopal Church, Newark, N.J. He was an instructor

and in the school of the National Academy of Design in
1889-1892. Mr Low, who is known to a wider circle as the
friend of R. L. Stevenson, published some reminiscences, <i>A

escutcheons. The more elegant examples of the Chippendale
period have cabriole legs, claw-and-ball feet and carved knees,
and are sometimes sculptured with the favourite shell motive
beneath the centre drawer.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOW CHURCHMAN,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> a term applied to members of the Church
of England or its daughter churches who, while accepting the
hierarchical and sacramental system of the Church, do not
consider episcopacy as essential to the constitution of the Church,
reject the doctrine that the sacraments confer grace <i>ex opere
operato</i> (<i>e.g.</i> baptismal regeneration) and lay stress on the Bible
as the sole source of authority in matters of faith. They thus
differ little from orthodox Protestants of other denominations,
and in general are prepared to co-operate with them on equal
terms.</p>

<p>The name was used in the early part of the 18th century as
the equivalent of &ldquo;Latitudinarian,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> one who was prepared to
concede much latitude in matters of discipline and faith, in
contradistinction to &ldquo;High Churchman,&rdquo; the term applied to
those who took a high view of the exclusive authority of the
Established Church, of episcopacy and of the sacramental
system. It subsequently fell into disuse, but was revived in the
19th century when the Tractarian movement had brought the
term &ldquo;High Churchman&rdquo; into vogue again in a modified sense,
<i>i.e.</i> for those who exalted the idea of the Catholic Church and the
sacramental system at the expense both of the Establishment
and of the exclusive authority of Scripture. &ldquo;Low Churchman&rdquo;
now became the equivalent of &ldquo;Evangelical,&rdquo; the designation of
the movement, associated with the name of Simeon, which laid the
chief stress on the necessity of personal &ldquo;conversion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Latitudinarian&rdquo;
gave place at the same time to &ldquo;Broad Churchman,&rdquo;
to designate those who lay stress on the ethical teaching of the
Church and minimize the value of orthodoxy. The revival of
pre-Reformation ritual by many of the High Church clergy led
to the designation &ldquo;ritualist&rdquo; being applied to them in a somewhat
contemptuous sense; and &ldquo;High Churchman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ritualist&rdquo; have often been wrongly treated as convertible
terms. Actually many High Churchmen are not Ritualists,
though they tend to become so. The High Churchman of the
&ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; type is further differentiated from the &ldquo;old-fashioned
High Churchman&rdquo; of what is sometimes described as
the &ldquo;high and dry&rdquo; type of the period anterior to the Oxford
Movement.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOWE, SIR HUDSON<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> (1769-1844), English general, was the
son of an army surgeon, John Lowe, and was born at Galway
on the 28th of July 1769. His mother was a native of that
county. His childhood was spent in various garrison towns
but he was educated chiefly at Salisbury grammar school. He
obtained a post as ensign in the East Devon Militia before his
twelfth year, and subsequently entered his father&rsquo;s regiment,
the 50th, then at Gibraltar (1787) under Governor-General
O&rsquo;Hara. After the outbreak of war with France early in 1793,
Lowe saw active service successively in Corsica, Elba, Portugal
and Minorca, where he was entrusted with the command of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
battalion of Corsican exiles, called The Corsican Rangers. With
these he did good work in Egypt in 1800-1801. After the peace
of Amiens, Lowe, now a major, became assistant quartermaster-general;
but on the renewal of war with France in 1803 he was
charged, as lieutenant-colonel, to raise the Corsican battalion
again and with it assisted in the defence of Sicily. On the
capture of Capri he proceeded thither with his battalion and a
Maltese regiment; but in October 1808 Murat organized an
attack upon the island, and Lowe, owing to the unsteadiness of
the Maltese troops and the want of succour by sea, had to agree
to evacuate the island. The terms in which Sir William Napier
and others have referred to Lowe&rsquo;s defence of Capri are unfair.
His garrison consisted of 1362 men, while the assailants numbered
between 3000 and 4000. In the course of the year 1809 Lowe
and his Corsicans helped in the capture of Ischia and Procida, as
well as of Zante, Cephalonia and Cerigo. For some months he
acted as governor of Cephalonia and Ithaca, and later on of
Santa Maura. He returned to England in 1812, and in January
1813 was sent to inspect a Russo-German legion then being
formed, and he accompanied the armies of the allies through the
campaigns of 1813 and 1814, being present at thirteen important
battles. He won praise from Blücher and Gneisenau for his
gallantry and judgment. He was chosen to bear to London the
news of the first abdication of Napoleon in April 1814. He was
then knighted and became major-general; he also received decorations
from the Russian and Prussian courts. Charged with the
duties of quartermaster-general of the army in the Netherlands in
1814-1815, he was about to take part in the Belgian campaign when
he was offered the command of the British troops at Genoa; but
while still in the south of France he received (on the 1st of August
1815) news of his appointment to the position of custodian of
Napoleon, who had surrendered to H.M.S. &ldquo;Bellerophon&rdquo; off
Rochefort. Lowe was to be governor of St Helena, the place of
the ex-emperor&rsquo;s exile.</p>

<p>On his arrival there at Plantation House he found that
Napoleon had already had scenes with Admiral Cockburn, of
H.M.S. &ldquo;Northumberland,&rdquo; and that he had sought to induce
the former governor, Colonel Wilks, to infringe the regulations
prescribed by the British government (see <i>Monthly Review</i>,
January 1901). Napoleon and his followers at Longwood
pressed for an extension of the limits within which he could move
without surveillance, but it was not in Lowe&rsquo;s power to grant this
request. Various matters, in some of which Lowe did not evince
much tact, produced friction between them. The news that
rescue expeditions were being planned by the Bonapartists in the
United States led to the enforcement of somewhat stricter
regulations in October 1816, Lowe causing sentries to be posted
round Longwood garden at sunset instead of at 9 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> This was
his great offence in the eyes of Napoleon and his followers. Hence
their efforts to calumniate Lowe, which had a surprising success.
O&rsquo;Meara, the British surgeon, became Napoleon&rsquo;s man, and lent
himself to the campaign of calumny in which Las Cases and
Montholon showed so much skill. In one of the suppressed
passages of his <i>Journal</i> Las Cases wrote that the exiles had to
&ldquo;reduce to a system our demeanour, our words, our sentiments,
even our privations, in order that we might thereby excite a
lively interest in a large portion of the population of Europe, and
that the opposition in England might not fail to attack the
ministry.&rdquo; As to the privations, it may be noted that Lowe
recommended that the government allowance of £8000 a year
to the Longwood household should be increased by one-half.
The charges of cruelty brought against the governor by O&rsquo;Meara
and others have been completely refuted; and the most that can
be said against him is that he was occasionally too suspicious
in the discharge of his duties. After the death of Napoleon in
May 1821, Lowe returned to England and received the thanks
of George IV. On the publication of O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s book he resolved
to prosecute the author, but, owing to an unaccountable delay,
the application was too late. This fact, together with the reserved
behaviour of Lowe, prejudiced the public against him, and the
government did nothing to clear his reputation. In 1825-1830
he commanded the forces in Ceylon, but was not appointed
to the governorship when it fell vacant in 1830. In 1842 he
became colonel of his old regiment, the 50th; he also received
the G.C.M.G. He died in 1844.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÖWE, JOHANN KARL GOTTFRIED<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> (1796-1869), German
composer, was born at Löbejün, near Halle, on the 30th of
November 1796, and was a choir-boy at Köthen from 1807
to 1809, when he went to the Franke Institute at Halle, studying
music with Türk. The beauty of Löwe&rsquo;s voice brought him
under the notice of Madame de Staël, who procured him a pension
from Jérôme Bonaparte, then king of Westphalia; this stopped
in 1813, on the flight of the king. He entered the University
of Halle as a theological student, but was appointed cantor at
Stettin in 1820, and director of the town music in 1821, in which
year he married Julie von Jacob, who died in 1823. His second
wife, Auguste Lange, was an accomplished singer, and they
appeared together in his oratorio performances with great success.
He retained his office at Stettin for 46 years, when, after a stroke
of paralysis, he was somewhat summarily dismissed. He
retired to Kiel, and died on the 20th of April 1869. He undertook
many concert tours during his tenure of the post at Stettin,
visiting Vienna, London, Sweden, Norway and Paris. His
high soprano voice (he could sing the music of the &ldquo;Queen
of Night&rdquo; in <i>Die Zauberflöte</i> as a boy) had developed into a
fine tenor. Löwe was a voluminous composer, and wrote five
operas, of which only one, <i>Die drei Wünsche</i>, was performed
at Berlin in 1834, without much success; seventeen oratorios,
many of them for male voices unaccompanied, or with short
instrumental interludes only; choral ballads, cantatas, three
string quartets, a pianoforte trio; a work for clarinet and piano,
published posthumously; and some piano solos. But the
branch of his art by which he is remembered, and in which he
must be admitted to have attained perfection, is the solo ballad
with pianoforte accompaniment. His treatment of long narrative
poems, in a clever mixture of the dramatic and lyrical styles,
was undoubtedly modelled on the ballads of Zumsteeg, and has
been copied by many composers since his day. His settings of
the &ldquo;Erlkönig&rdquo; (a very early example), &ldquo;Archibald Douglas,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Heinrich der Vogler,&rdquo; &ldquo;Edward&rdquo; and &ldquo;Die Verfallene
Mühle,&rdquo; are particularly fine.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOWELL, ABBOTT LAWRENCE<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (1856-&emsp;&emsp;), American
educationalist, was born in Boston, Massachusetts on the 13th
of December 1856, the great-grandson of John Lowell, the
&ldquo;Columella of New England,&rdquo; and on his mother&rsquo;s side, a grandson
of Abbott Lawrence. He graduated at Harvard College
in 1877, with highest honours in mathematics; graduated at
the Harvard Law School in 1880; and practised law in 1880-1897
in partnership with his cousin, Francis Cabot Lowell
(b. 1855), with whom he wrote <i>Transfer of Stock in Corporations</i>
(1884). In 1897 he became lecturer and in 1898 professor of
government at Harvard, and in 1909 succeeded Charles William
Eliot as president of the university. In the same year he was
president of the American Political Science Association. In
1900 he had succeeded his father, Augustus Lowell (1830-1901),
as financial head of the Lowell Institute of Boston. He
wrote <i>Essays on Government</i> (1889), <i>Governments and Parties in
Continental Europe</i> (2 vols., 1896), <i>Colonial Civil Service</i> (1900;
with an account by H. Morse Stephens of the East India College
at Haileybury), and <i>The Government of England</i> (2 vols., 1908).</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Percival Lowell</span> (1855-&emsp;&emsp;), the well-known
astronomer, graduated at Harvard in 1876, lived much in Japan
between 1883 and 1893, and in 1894 established at Flagstaff,
Arizona, the Lowell Observatory, of whose <i>Annals</i> (from 1898)
he was editor. In 1902 he became non-resident professor of
astronomy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He
wrote several books on the Far East, including <i>Chosön</i> (1885),

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
<i>of Japan</i> (1891), and <i>Occult Japan</i> (1895), but he is best known

his contention that the &ldquo;canals&rdquo; of Mars are a sign of life and
civilization on that planet (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mars</a></span>). He published <i>The

<p><span class="bold">LOWELL, CHARLES RUSSELL<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> (1835-1864), American
soldier, was born on the 2nd of January 1835 in Boston, Massachusetts.
His mother, Anna Cabot Jackson Lowell (1819-1874),
a daughter of Patrick Tracy Jackson, married Charles Russell
Lowell, a brother of James Russell Lowell; she wrote verse and
books on education. Her son graduated at Harvard in 1854,
worked in an iron mill in Trenton, New Jersey, for a few months
in 1855, spent two years abroad, and in 1858-1860 was local
treasurer of the Burlington &amp; Missouri river railroad. In 1860
he took charge of the Mount Savage Iron Works, in Cumberland,
Maryland. He entered the Union army in June 1861 (commission
May 14) as captain of the 3rd (afterwards 6th) U.S. cavalry;
on the 15th of April 1863 he became colonel of the 2nd Massachusetts
cavalry; he was wounded fatally at Cedar Creek on
the 19th of October 1864, when he was promoted brigadier-general
of U.S. Volunteers, and died on the next day at Middletown,
Va. Lowell married in October 1863, Josephine Shaw
(1843-1905), a sister of Colonel R. G. Shaw. Her home when
she was married was on Staten Island, and she became deeply
interested in the social problems of New York City. She was a
member of the State Charities Aid Society, and from 1877 to
1889 was a member of the New York State Board of Charities,
being the first woman appointed to that board. She founded
the Charity Organization Society of New York City in 1882,
and wrote <i>Public Relief and Private Charity</i> (1884) and <i>Industrial
Arbitration and Conciliation</i> (1893).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOWELL, JAMES RUSSELL<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (1819-1891), American author
and diplomatist, was born at Elmwood, in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
on the 22nd of February 1819, the son of Charles
Lowell (1782-1861).<a name="fa1u" id="fa1u" href="#ft1u"><span class="sp">1</span></a> On his mother&rsquo;s side he was descended from
the Spences and Traills, who made their home in the Orkney
Islands, his great-grandfather, Robert Traill, returning to England
on the breaking out of hostilities in 1775. He was brought up
in a neighbourhood bordering on the open country, and from
his earliest years he found a companion in nature; he was
also early initiated into the reading of poetry and romance,
hearing Spenser and Scott in childhood, and introduced to old
ballads by his mother. He had for schoolmaster an Englishman
who held by the traditions of English schools, so that before he
entered Harvard College he had a more familiar acquaintance
with Latin verse than most of his fellows&mdash;a familiarity which
showed itself later in his mock-pedantic accompaniment to
<i>The Biglow Papers</i> and his macaronic poetry. He was a wide
reader, but a somewhat indifferent student, graduating at
Harvard without special honours in 1838. During his college
course he wrote a number of trivial pieces for a college magazine,
and shortly after graduating printed for private circulation
the poem which his class asked him to write for their graduation
festivities.</p>

<p>He was uncertain at first what vocation to choose, and vacillated
between business, the ministry, medicine and law. He
decided at last to practise law, and after a course at the Harvard
law school, was admitted to the bar. While studying for his
profession, however, he contributed poems and prose articles
to various magazines. He cared little for the law, regarding
it simply as a distasteful means of livelihood, yet his experiments
in writing did not encourage him to trust to this for support.
An unhappy adventure in love deepened his sense of failure,
but he became betrothed to Maria White in the autumn of
1840, and the next twelve years of his life were deeply affected
by her influence. She was a poet of delicate power, but also
possessed a lofty enthusiasm, a high conception of purity and
justice, and a practical temper which led her to concern herself
in the movements directed against the evils of intemperance
and slavery. Lowell was already looked upon by his companions
as a man marked by wit and poetic sentiment; Miss White
was admired for her beauty, her character and her intellectual
gifts, and the two became thus the hero and heroine among a
group of ardent young men and women. The first-fruits of this
passion was a volume of poems, published in 1841, entitled
<i>A Year&rsquo;s Life</i>, which was inscribed by Lowell in a veiled dedication
to his future wife, and was a record of his new emotions
with a backward glance at the preceding period of depression
and irresolution. The betrothal, moreover, stimulated Lowell
to new efforts towards self-support, and though nominally
maintaining his law office, he threw his energy into the establishment,
in company with a friend, Robert Carter, of a literary
journal, to which the young men gave the name of <i>The Pioneer</i>.
It was to open the way to new ideals in literature and art, and
the writers to whom Lowell turned for assistance&mdash;Hawthorne,
Emerson, Whittier, Poe, Story and Parsons, none of them
yet possessed of a wide reputation&mdash;indicate the acumen of the
editor. Lowell himself had already turned his studies in dramatic
and early poetic literature to account in another magazine,
and continued the series in <i>The Pioneer</i>, besides contributing
poems; but after the issue of three monthly numbers, beginning
in January 1843, the magazine came to an end, partly because
of a sudden disaster which befell Lowell&rsquo;s eyes, partly through
the inexperience of the conductors and unfortunate business
connexions.</p>

<p>The venture confirmed Lowell in his bent towards literature.
At the close of 1843 he published a collection of his poems, and
a year later he gathered up certain material which he had printed,
sifted and added to it, and produced <i>Conversations on some of
the Old Poets</i>. The dialogue form was used merely to secure
an undress manner of approach to his subject; there was no
attempt at the dramatic. The book reflects curiously Lowell&rsquo;s
mind at this time, for the conversations relate only partly to
the poets and dramatists of the Elizabethan period; a slight
suggestion sends the interlocutors off on the discussion of current
reforms in church and state and society. Literature and reform
were dividing the author&rsquo;s mind, and continued to do so for the
next decade. Just as this book appeared Lowell and Miss White
were married, and spent the winter and early spring of 1845
in Philadelphia. Here, besides continuing his literary contributions
to magazines, Lowell had a regular engagement as an
editorial writer on <i>The Pennsylvania Freeman</i>, a fortnightly
journal devoted to the Anti-Slavery cause. In the spring of
1845 the Lowells returned to Cambridge and made their home
at Elmwood. On the last day of the year their first child,
Blanche, was born, but she lived only fifteen months. A second
daughter, Mabel, was born six months after Blanche&rsquo;s death,
and lived to survive her father; a third, Rose, died an infant.
Lowell&rsquo;s mother meanwhile was living, sometimes at home, sometimes
at a neighbouring hospital, with clouded mind, and his
wife was in frail health. These troubles and a narrow income
conspired to make Lowell almost a recluse in these days, but
from the retirement of Elmwood he sent forth writings which
show how large an interest he took in affairs. He contributed
poems to the daily press, called out by the Slavery question;
he was, early in 1846, a correspondent of the London <i>Daily News</i>,
and in the spring of 1848 he formed a connexion with the <i>National
Anti-Slavery Standard</i> of New York, by which he agreed to furnish
weekly either a poem or a prose article. The poems were most
frequently works of art, occasionally they were tracts; but
the prose was almost exclusively concerned with the public
men and questions of the day, and forms a series of incisive,
witty and sometimes prophetic diatribes. It was a period with
him of great mental activity, and is represented by four of his
books which stand as admirable witnesses to the Lowell of 1848,
namely, the second series of <i>Poems</i>, containing among others
&ldquo;Columbus,&rdquo; &ldquo;An Indian Summer Reverie,&rdquo; &ldquo;To the Dandelion,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Changeling&rdquo;; <i>A Fable for Critics</i>, in which, after
the manner of Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s <i>The Feast of the Poets</i>, he characterizes
in witty verse and with good-natured satire American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
contemporary writers, and in which, the publication being anonymous,
he included himself; <i>The Vision of Sir Launfal</i>, a
romantic story suggested by the Arthurian legends&mdash;one of his
most popular poems; and finally <i>The Biglow Papers</i>.</p>

<p>Lowell had acquired a reputation among men of letters and
a cultivated class of readers, but this satire at once brought
him a wider fame. The book was not premeditated; a single
poem, called out by the recruiting for the abhorred Mexican
war, couched in rustic phrase and sent to the <i>Boston Courier</i>,
had the inspiriting dash and electrifying rat-tat-tat of this
new recruiting sergeant in the little army of Anti-Slavery reformers.
Lowell himself discovered what he had done at the
same time that the public did, and he followed the poem with
eight others either in the <i>Courier</i> or the <i>Anti-Slavery Standard</i>.
He developed four well-defined characters in the process&mdash;a
country farmer, Ezekiel Biglow, and his son Hosea; the Rev.
Homer Wilbur, a shrewd old-fashioned country minister; and
Birdofredum Sawin, a Northern renegade who enters the army,
together with one or two subordinate characters; and his
stinging satire and sly humour are so set forth in the vernacular
of New England as to give at once a historic dignity to this
form of speech. (Later he wrote an elaborate paper to show
the survival in New England of the English of the early 17th
century.) He embroidered his verse with an entertaining
apparatus of notes and mock criticism. Even his index was
spiced with wit. The book, a caustic arraignment of the course
taken in connexion with the annexation of Texas and the war
with Mexico, made a strong impression, and the political philosophy
secreted in its lines became a part of household literature.
It is curious to observe how repeatedly this arsenal was drawn
upon in the discussions in America about the &ldquo;Imperialistic&rdquo;
developments of 1900. The death of Lowell&rsquo;s mother, and the
fragility of his wife&rsquo;s health, led Lowell, with his wife, their
daughter Mabel and their infant son Walter, to go to Europe
in 1851, and they went direct to Italy. The early months of
their stay were saddened by the death of Walter in Rome, and
by the news of the illness of Lowell&rsquo;s father, who had a slight shock
of paralysis. They returned in November 1852, and Lowell
published some recollections of his journey in the magazines,
collecting the sketches later in a prose volume, <i>Fireside Travels</i>.
He took some part also in the editing of an American edition
of the <i>British Poets</i>, but the low state of his wife&rsquo;s health kept
him in an uneasy condition, and when her death (27th October
1853) released him from the strain of anxiety, there came with
the grief a readjustment of his nature and a new intellectual
activity. At the invitation of his cousin, he delivered a course
of lectures on English poets before the Lowell Institute in Boston
in the winter of 1855. This first formal appearance as a critic
and historian of literature at once gave him a new standing
in the community, and was the occasion of his election to the
Smith Professorship of Modern Languages in Harvard College,
then vacant by the retirement of Longfellow. Lowell accepted
the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year
of study abroad. He spent his time mainly in Germany, visiting
Italy, and increasing his acquaintance with the French, German,
Italian and Spanish tongues. He returned to America in the
summer of 1856, and entered upon his college duties, retaining
his position for twenty years. As a teacher he proved himself
a quickener of thought amongst students, rather than a close
and special instructor. His power lay in the interpretation of
literature rather than in linguistic study, and his influence over
his pupils was exercised by his own fireside as well as in the
relation, always friendly and familiar, which he held to them
in the classroom. In 1856 he married Miss Frances Dunlap,
a lady who had since his wife&rsquo;s death had charge of his daughter
Mabel.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1857 <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> was established,
and Lowell was its first editor. He at once gave the magazine
the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs.
He held this position only till the spring of 1861, but he continued
to make the magazine the vehicle of his poetry and of some
prose for the rest of his life; his prose, however, was more
abundantly presented in the pages of <i>The North American
Review</i> during the years 1862-1872, when he was associated with
Mr Charles Eliot Norton in its conduct. This magazine especially
gave him the opportunity of expression of political views during
the eventful years of the War of the Union. It was in <i>The
Atlantic</i> during the same period that he published a second
series of <i>The Biglow Papers</i>. Both his collegiate and editorial
duties stimulated his critical powers, and the publication in the
two magazines, followed by republication in book form, of a
series of studies of great authors, gave him an important place
as a critic. Shakespeare, Dryden, Lessing, Rousseau, Dante,
Spenser, Wordsworth, Milton, Keats, Carlyle, Thoreau, Swinburne,
Chaucer, Emerson, Pope, Gray&mdash;these are the principal subjects
of his prose, and the range of topics indicates the catholicity of
his taste. He wrote also a number of essays, such as &ldquo;My Garden
Acquaintance,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Good Word for Winter,&rdquo; &ldquo;On a Certain
Condescension in Foreigners,&rdquo; which were incursions into the
field of nature and society. Although the great bulk of his
writing was now in prose, he made after this date some of his
most notable ventures in poetry. In 1868 he issued the next
collection in <i>Under the Willows and other Poems</i>, but in 1865
he had delivered his &ldquo;Ode recited at the Harvard Commemoration,&rdquo;
and the successive centennial historical anniversaries
drew from him a series of stately odes.</p>

<p>In 1877 Lowell, who had mingled so little in party politics
that the sole public office he had held was the nominal one of
elector in the Presidential election of 1876, was appointed by
President Hayes minister resident at the court of Spain. He
had a good knowledge of Spanish language and literature, and
his long-continued studies in history and his quick judgment
enabled him speedily to adjust himself to these new relations.
Some of his despatches to the home government were published
in a posthumous volume&mdash;<i>Impressions of Spain</i>. In 1880 he
was transferred to London as American minister, and remained
there till the close of President Arthur&rsquo;s administration in the
spring of 1885. As a man of letters he was already well known
in England, and he was in much demand as an orator on public
occasions, especially of a literary nature; but he also proved
himself a sagacious publicist, and made himself a wise interpreter
of each country to the other. Shortly after his retirement from
public life he published <i>Democracy and other Addresses</i>, all of
which had been delivered in England. The title address was an
epigrammatic confession of political faith as hopeful as it was
wise and keen. The close of his stay in England was saddened
by the death of his second wife in 1885. After his return to
America he made several visits to England. His public life had
made him more of a figure in the world; he was decorated with
the highest honours Harvard could pay officially, and with
degrees of Oxford, Cambridge, St Andrews, Edinburgh and
Bologna. He issued another collection of his poems, <i>Heartsease
and Rue</i>, in 1888, and occupied himself with revising and rearranging
his works, which were published in ten volumes in
1890. The last months of his life were attended by illness, and
he died at Elmwood on the 12th of August 1891. After his
death his literary executor, Charles Eliot Norton, published a
brief collection of his poems, and two volumes of added prose,
besides editing his letters.</p>

<p>The spontaneity of Lowell&rsquo;s nature is delightfully disclosed
in his personal letters. They are often brilliant, and sometimes
very penetrating in their judgment of men and books; but the
most constant element is a pervasive humour, and this humour,
by turns playful and sentimental, is largely characteristic of his
poetry, which sprang from a genial temper, quick in its sympathy
with nature and humanity. The literary refinement which
marks his essays in prose is not conspicuous in his verse, which
is of a more simple character. There was an apparent conflict
in him of the critic and the creator, but the conflict was superficial.
The man behind both critical and creative work was so genuine,
that through his writings and speech and action he impressed
himself deeply upon his generation in America, especially upon
the thoughtful and scholarly class who looked upon him as
especially their representative. This is not to say that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
a man of narrow sympathies. On the contrary, he was democratic
in his thought, and outspoken in his rebuke of whatever
seemed to him antagonistic to the highest freedom. Thus,
without taking a very active part in political life, he was recognized
as one of the leaders of independent political thought.
He found expression in so many ways, and was apparently so
inexhaustible in his resources, that his very versatility and the
ease with which he gave expression to his thought sometimes
stood in the way of a recognition of his large, simple political
ideality and the singleness of his moral sight.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOWELL, JOHN<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> (1743-1802), American jurist, was born in
Newburyport, Massachusetts, on the 17th of June 1743, and
was a son of the Reverend John Lowell, the first pastor of
Newburyport, and a descendant of Perceval Lowle or Lowell
(1571-1665), who emigrated from Somersetshire to Massachusetts
Bay in 1639 and was the founder of the family in New England.
John Lowell graduated at Harvard in 1760, was admitted to the
bar in 1763, represented Newburyport (1776) and Boston (1778)
in the Massachusetts Assembly, was a member of the Massachusetts
Constitutional Convention of 1779-1780 and, as a
member of the committee appointed to draft a constitution,
secured the insertion of the clause, &ldquo;all men are born free and
equal,&rdquo; which was interpreted by the supreme court of the state
in 1783 as abolishing slavery in the state. In 1781-1783 he
was a member of the Continental Congress, which in 1782 made
him a judge of the court of appeals for admiralty cases; in
1784 he was one of the commissioners from Massachusetts to
settle the boundary line between Massachusetts and New York;
in 1789-1801 he was a judge of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts;
and from 1801 until his death in Roxbury on the
6th of May 1802 he was a justice of the U.S. Circuit Court
for the First Circuit (Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts
and Rhode Island).</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">John Lowell</span> (1769-1840), graduated at Harvard in
1786, was admitted to the bar in 1789 (like his father, before he
was twenty years old), and retired from active practice in 1803.
He opposed French influence and the policies of the Democratic
party, writing many spirited pamphlets (some signed &ldquo;The
Boston Rebel,&rdquo; some &ldquo;The Roxbury Farmer&rdquo;), including:
<i>The Antigallican</i> (1797), <i>Remarks on the Hon. J. Q. Adams&rsquo;s
Review of Mr Ames&rsquo;s Works</i> (1809), <i>New England Patriot,
being a Candid Comparison of the Principles and Conduct of the
Washington and Jefferson Administrations</i> (1810), <i>Appeals to the
People on the Causes and Consequences of War with Great Britain</i>
(1811) and <i>Mr Madison&rsquo;s War</i> (1812). These pamphlets contain
an extreme statement of the anti-war party and defend impressment
as a right of long standing. After the war Lowell abandoned
politics, and won for himself the title of &ldquo;the Columella of New
England&rdquo; by his interest in agriculture&mdash;he was for many years
president of the Massachusetts Agricultural Society. He was a
benefactor of the Boston Athenaeum and the Massachusetts
General Hospital.</p>

<p>Another son of the first John Lowell, <span class="sc">Francis Cabot Lowell</span>
(1775-1817), the founder in the United States of cotton manufacturing,
was born in Newburyport on the 7th of April 1775,
graduated at Harvard in 1793, became a merchant in Boston,
and, during the war of 1812, with his cousin (who was also
his brother-in-law), Patrick Tracy Jackson, made use of the
knowledge of cotton-spinning gained by Lowell in England
(whither he had gone for his health in 1810) and devised a power
loom. Experiments were successfully carried on at Waltham in
1814. Lowell worked hard to secure a protective tariff on cotton
goods. The city of Lowell, Massachusetts, was named in his
honour. He died in Boston on the 10th of August 1817.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Charles Lowell</span> (1782-1861), brother of the last named,
was born in Boston, graduated at Harvard in 1800, studied law
and then theology, and after two years in Edinburgh and one year
on the Continent was from 1806 until his death pastor of the
West Congregational (Unitarian) Church of Boston, a charge
in which Cyrus A. Bartol was associated with him after 1837.
Charles Lowell had a rare sweetness and charm, which reappeared
in his youngest son, James Russell Lowell (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>Francis Cabot Lowell&rsquo;s son, <span class="sc">John Lowell</span> (1799-1836), was
born in Boston, travelled in India and the East Indies on business
in 1816 and 1817, in 1832 set out on a trip around the world, and
on the 4th of March 1836 died in Bombay. By a will made, said
Edward Everett, &ldquo;on the top of a palace of the Pharaohs,&rdquo;
he left $237,000 to establish what is now known as the Lowell
Institute (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">

Everett&rsquo;s <i>A Memoir of Mr John Lowell, Jr.</i> (Boston, 1840).</p>
</div>

<p>A grandson of Francis Cabot Lowell, <span class="sc">Edward Jackson
Lowell</span> (1845-1894), graduated at Harvard in 1867, was
admitted to the Suffolk county (Mass.) bar in 1872, and practised
law for a few years. He wrote <i>The Hessians and the Other German
Auxiliaries of Great Britain in the Revolutionary War</i> (1884),
<i>The Eve of the French Revolution</i> (1892) and the chapter, &ldquo;The
United States of America 1775-1782: their Political Relations
with Europe,&rdquo; in vol. vii. (1888) of Winsor&rsquo;s <i>Narrative and
Critical History of America</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOWELL,<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> a city and one of the county-seats (Cambridge
being the other) of Middlesex county, Massachusetts, U.S.A.,
situated in the N.E. part of the county at the confluence of the
Concord and Merrimack rivers, about 25 m. N.W. of Boston.
Pop. (1890) 77,696; (1900) 94,969, of whom 40,974 were foreign-born
(14,674 being French Canadian, 12,147 Irish, 4485
English Canadian, 4446 English, 1203 Greek, 1099 Scotch);
(1910 census), 106,294. Lowell is served by the Boston &amp;
Maine and the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford railways, and
by inter-urban electric lines. The area of Lowell is 14.1 sq. m.,
much the larger part of which is S. of the Merrimack. The city
is irregularly laid out. Its centre is Monument Square, in
Merrimack Street, where are a granite monument to the first
Northerners killed in the Civil War, Luther C. Ladd and A. O.
Whitney (both of Lowell), whose regiment was mobbed in
Baltimore on the 19th of April 1861 while marching to Washington;
and a bronze figure of Victory (after one by Rauch in
the Valhalla at Ratisbon), commemorating the Northern triumph
in the Civil War. The Lowell textile school, opened in 1897,
offers courses in cotton manufacturing, wool manufacturing,
designing, chemistry and dyeing, and textile engineering;
evening drawing schools and manual training in the public
schools have contributed to the high degree of technical perfection
in the factories. The power gained from the Pawtucket
Falls in the Merrimack river has long been found insufficient
for these. A network of canals supplies from 14,000 to
24,000 h.p.; and a small amount is also furnished by the Concord
river, but about 26,000 h.p. is supplied by steam. In factory
output ($46,879,212 in 1905; $41,202,984 in 1900) Lowell
ranked fifth in value in 1905 and fourth in 1900 among the
cities of Massachusetts; more than three-tenths of the total
population are factory wage-earners, and nearly 19 % of the
population are in the cotton mills. Formerly Lowell was called
the &ldquo;Spindle City&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Manchester of America,&rdquo; but
it was long ago surpassed in the manufacture of textiles by Fall
River and New Bedford: in 1905 the value of the cotton product
of Lowell, $19,340,925, was less than 60 % of the value of cotton
goods made at Fall River. Woollen goods made in Lowell in 1905
were valued at $2,579,363; hosiery and knitted goods, at
$3,816,964; worsted goods, at $1,978,552. Carpets and textile
machinery are allied manufactures of importance. There are
other factories for machinery, patent medicines, boots and shoes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
perfumery and cosmetics, hosiery and rubber heels. Lowell was
the home of the inventor of rubber heels, Humphrey O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p>

<p>The founders of Lowell were Patrick Tracy Jackson (1780-1847),
Nathan Appleton (1779-1861), Paul Moody (1779-1831)
and the business manager chosen by them, Kirk Boott (1790-1837).
The opportunity for developing water-power by the
purchase of the canal around Pawtucket Falls (chartered for
navigation in 1792) led them to choose the adjacent village
of East Chelmsford as the site of their projected cotton mills;
they bought the Pawtucket canal, and incorporated in 1822
the Merrimack Manufacturing Company; in 1823 the first cloth
was actually made, and in 1826 a separate township was formed
from part of Chelmsford and was named in honour of Francis
Cabot Lowell, who with Jackson had improved Cartwright&rsquo;s
power loom, and had planned the mills at Waltham. In 1836
Lowell was chartered as a city. Lowell annexed parts of Tewksbury
in 1834, 1874, 1888 and 1906, and parts of Dracut in 1851,
1874 and 1879. Up to 1840 the mill hands, with the exception
of English dyers and calico printers, were New England girls.
The &ldquo;corporation,&rdquo; as the employers were called, provided
from the first for the welfare of their employees, and Lowell
has always been notably free from labour disturbances.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The character of the early employees of the mills, later largely
displaced by French Canadians and Irish, and by immigrants from
various parts of Europe, is clearly seen in the periodical, <i>The Lowell
Offering</i>, written and published by them in 1840-1845. This
monthly magazine, organized by the Rev. Abel Charles Thomas (1807-1880),
pastor of the First Universalist Church, was from October
1840 to March 1841 made up of articles prepared for some of the
many improvement circles or literary societies; it then became
broader in its scope, received more spontaneous contributions, and
from October 1842 until December 1845 was edited by Harriot F.
Curtis (1813-1889), known by her pen name, &ldquo;Mina Myrtle,&rdquo; and
by Harriet Farley (1817-1907), who became manager and proprietor,
and published selections from the <i>Offering</i> under the titles <i>Shells
from the Strand of the Sea of Genius</i> (1847) and <i>Mind among the
Spindles</i> (1849), with an introduction by Charles Knight. In 1854
she married John Intaglio Donlevy (d. 1872). Famous contributors
to the <i>Offering</i> were Harriet Hanson (b. 1825) and Lucy Larcom
(1824-1893). Harriet Hanson wrote <i>Early Factory Labor in New
England</i> (1883) and <i>Loom and Spindle</i> (1898), an important contribution
to the industrial and social history of Lowell. She was
prominent in the anti-slavery and woman suffrage agitations in
Massachusetts, and wrote <i>Massachusetts in the Woman Suffrage
Movement</i> (1881). She married in 1848 William Stevens Robinson
(1818-1876), who wrote in 1856-1876 the political essays signed
&ldquo;Warrington&rdquo; for the <i>Springfield Republican</i>. Lucy Larcom,<a name="fa1v" id="fa1v" href="#ft1v"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
born in Beverly, came to Lowell in 1835, where her widowed mother
kept a &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; boarding-house, and where she became a
&ldquo;doffer,&rdquo; changing bobbins in the mills. She wrote much, especially
for the <i>Offering</i>; became an ardent abolitionist and (in 1843) the
friend of Whittier; left Lowell in 1846, and taught for several years,
first in Illinois, and then in Beverly and Norton, Massachusetts.
<i>An Idyl of Work</i> (1875) describes the life of the mills and <i>A New
England Girlhood</i> (1889) is autobiographical; she wrote many stories
and poems, of which <i>Hannah Binding Shoes</i> is best known.</p>

<p>Benjamin F. Butler was from boyhood a resident of Lowell,
where he began to practise law in 1841. James McNeill Whistler
was born here in 1834, and in 1907 his birthplace in Worthen Street
was purchased by the Art Association to be used as its headquarters
and as an art museum and gallery; it was dedicated in 1908, and in
the same year a replica of Rodin&rsquo;s statue of Whistler was bought for
the city.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOWELL INSTITUTE,<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> an educational foundation in Boston,
Massachusetts, U.S.A., providing for free public lectures, and endowed
by the bequest of $237,000 left by John Lowell, junior, who
died in 1836. Under the terms of his will 10% of the net income
was to be added to the principal, which in 1909 was over a million
dollars. None of the fund was to be invested in a building
for the lectures; the trustees of the Boston Athenaeum were
made visitors of the fund; but the trustee of the fund is authorized
to select his own successor, although in doing so he must
&ldquo;always choose in preference to all others some male descendant
of my grandfather John Lowell, provided there is one who
is competent to hold the office of trustee, and of the name of
Lowell,&rdquo; the sole trustee so appointed having the entire selection
of the lecturers and the subjects of lectures. The first trustee
was John Lowell junior&rsquo;s cousin, John Amory Lowell, who
administered the trust for more than forty years, and was
succeeded in 1881 by his son, Augustus Lowell, who in turn
was succeeded in 1900 by his son Abbott Lawrence Lowell, who
in 1909 became president of Harvard University.</p>

<p>The founder provided for two kinds of lectures, one popular,
&ldquo;and the other more abstruse, erudite and particular.&rdquo; The
popular lectures have taken the form of courses usually ranging
from half a dozen to a dozen lectures, and covering almost every
subject. The fees have always been large, and many of the most
eminent men in America and Europe have lectured there. A
large number of books have been published which consist of
those lectures or have been based upon them. As to the advanced
lectures, the founder seems to have had in view what is now
called university extension, and in this he was far in advance
of his time; but he did not realize that such work can only be
done effectively in connexion with a great school. In pursuance
of this provision public instruction of various kinds has been
given from time to time by the Institute. The first freehand
drawing in Boston was taught there, but was given up when the
public schools undertook it. In the same way a school of practical
design was carried on for many years, but finally, in 1903, was
transferred to the Museum of Fine Arts. Instruction for working
men was given at the Wells Memorial Institute until 1908, when
the Franklin Foundation took up the work. A Teachers&rsquo; School
of Science is maintained in co-operation with the Natural History
Society. For many years advanced courses of lectures were
given by the professors of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, but in 1904 they were superseded by an evening
school for industrial foremen. In 1907, under the title of
&ldquo;Collegiate Courses,&rdquo; a number of the elementary courses
in Harvard University were offered free to the public under the
same conditions of study and examination as in the university.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÖWENBERG,<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province
of Silesia, on the Bober, 39 m. E. of Görlitz by rail. Pop. 5682.
It is one of the oldest towns in Silesia; its town hall dates
from the 16th century, and it has a Roman Catholic church
built in the 13th century and restored in 1862. The town has
sandstone and gypsum quarries, breweries and woollen mills,
and cultivates fruit and vegetables. Löwenberg became a
town in 1217 and has been the scene of much fighting, especially
during the Napoleonic wars. Near the town is the village and
estate of Hohlstein, the property of the Hohenzollern family.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÖWENSTEIN,<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the kingdom of
Württemberg, capital of the mediatized county of that name,
situated under the north slope of the Löwenstein range, 6 m.
from Heilbronn. Pop. 1527. It is dominated by the ruined
castle of the counts of Löwenstein, and enclosed by medieval
walls. The town contains many picturesque old houses. There
is also a modern palace. The cultivation of vines is the chief
industry, and there is a brine spring (Theusserbad).</p>

<p>Löwenstein was founded in 1123 by the counts of Calw, and
belonged to the Habsburgs from 1281 to 1441. In 1634 the
castle was destroyed by the imperialists. The county of Löwenstein
belonged to a branch of the family of the counts of Calw
before 1281, when it was purchased by the German king Rudolph
I., who presented it to his natural son Albert. In 1441 Henry,
one of Albert&rsquo;s descendants, sold it to the elector palatine of
the Rhine, Frederick I., and later it served as a portion for
Louis (d. 1524), a son of the elector by a morganatic marriage,
who became a count of the Empire in 1494. Louis&rsquo;s grandson
Louis II. (d. 1611) inherited the county of Wertheim and other
lands by marriage and called himself count of Löwenstein-Wertheim;
his two sons divided the family into two branches.
The heads of the two branches, into which the older and Protestant
line was afterwards divided, were made princes by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
king of Bavaria in 1812 and by the king of Württemberg in
1813; the head of the younger, or Roman Catholic line, was
made a prince of the Empire in 1711. Both lines are flourishing,
their present representatives being Ernst (b. 1854) prince of
Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg, and Aloyse (b. 1871) prince
of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. The lands of the family
were mediatized after the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.
The area of the county of Löwenstein was about 53 sq. m.</p>

in the Lowestoft parliamentary division of Suffolk, England,
117½ m. N.E. from London by the Great Eastern railway.
Pop. (1901) 29,850. It lies on either side of the formerly
natural, now artificial outlet of the river Waveney to the North
Sea, while to the west the river forms Oulton Broad and Lothing
Lake. The northern bank is the original site. South Lowestoft
arose on the completion of harbour improvements, begun in
1844, when the outlet of the Waveney, reopened in 1827, was
deepened. The old town is picturesquely situated on a lofty
declivity, which includes the most easterly point of land in
England. The church of St Margaret is Decorated and Perpendicular.
South Lowestoft has a fine esplanade, a park
(Bellevue) and other adjuncts of a watering-place. Bathing
facilities are good. There are two piers enclosing a harbour with
a total area of 48 acres, having a depth of about 16 ft. at high
tide. The fisheries are important and some 600 smacks belong
to the port. Industries include ship and boat building and
fitting, and motor engineering. The town is governed by a
mayor, 8 aldermen and 24 councillors. Area 2178 acres.</p>

<p>Lowestoft (Lothu Wistoft, Lowistoft, Loistoft) owes its origin
to its fisheries. In 1086 it was a hamlet in the demesne of the
royal manor of Lothingland. The men of Lowestoft as tenants
on ancient demesne of the crown possessed many privileges,
but had no definite burghal rights until 1885. For several
centuries before 1740 the fisheries were the cause of constant
dispute between Lowestoft and Yarmouth. During the last
half of the 18th century the manufacture of china flourished in
the town. A weekly market on Wednesdays was granted to
John, earl of Richmond, in 1308 together with an eight days&rsquo;
fair beginning on the vigil of St Margaret&rsquo;s day, and in 1445
John de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, one of his successors as lord of
the manor, received a further grant of the same market and also
two yearly fairs, one on the feast of St Philip and St James and
the other at Michaelmas. The market is still held on Wednesdays,
and in 1792 the Michaelmas fair and another on May-day
were in existence. Now two yearly fairs for small wares are held
on the 13th of May and the 11th of October. In 1643 Cromwell
performed one of his earlier exploits in taking Lowestoft, capturing
large supplies and making prisoners of several influential
royalists. In the war of 1665 the Dutch under Admiral Opdam
were defeated off Lowestoft by the English fleet commanded by
the duke of York.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOWIN, JOHN<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (1576-1659), English actor, was born in London,
the son of a carpenter. His name frequently occurs in Henslowe&rsquo;s
Diary in 1602, when he was playing at the Rose Theatre in the
earl of Worcester&rsquo;s company, and he was at the Blackfriars in
1603, playing with Shakespeare, Burbage and the others, and
owning&mdash;by 1608&mdash;a share and a half of the twenty shares in
that theatre. About 1623 he was one of the managers. He lived
in Southwark, and Edward Alleyn speaks of his dining with him
in 1620. &ldquo;Lowin in his latter days kept an inn (the Three Pigeons)
at Brentford, where he deyed very old.&rdquo; Two of his favourite
parts were Falstaff, and Melanteus in <i>The Maid&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>.</p>

professorship of astronomy at Cambridge university, England,
was born in 1692, both his father and mother being Cheshire
landowners. In 1725 he was appointed provost marshal of
South Carolina, a post he preferred to fill by deputy. In 1727
Lowndes claimed to have taken a prominent part in inducing
the British government to purchase Carolina, but he surrendered
his patent when the transfer of the colony to the crown was
completed. His patent was renewed in 1730, but he resigned
it in 1733. He then brought various impractical schemes before
the government to check the illicit trade in wool between Ireland
and France; to regulate the paper currency of New England;
and to supply the navy with salt from brine, &amp;c. He died on the
12th of May 1748. By his will he left his inherited Cheshire
properties to the university of Cambridge for the foundation of
a chair of astronomy and geometry.</p>

His principal work, <i>The Bibliographer&rsquo;s Manual of English

in four volumes in 1834. It took Lowndes fourteen years to
compile, but, despite its merits, brought him neither fame nor

cataloguer to Henry George Bohn, the bookseller and publisher.
In 1839 he published the first parts of <i>The British Librarian</i>,

<p><span class="bold">LOWTH, ROBERT<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1710-1787), English divine and Orientalist,
was born at Winchester on the 27th of November 1710. He was
the younger son of William Lowth (1661-1732), rector of Buriton,
Hampshire, a theologian of considerable ability. Robert was
educated on the foundation of Winchester College, and in 1729
was elected to a scholarship at New College, Oxford. He graduated
M.A. in 1737, and in 1741 he was appointed professor of
poetry at Oxford, in which capacity he delivered the <i>Praelectiones
Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum</i>. Bishop Hoadly appointed
him in 1744 to the rectory of Ovington, Hampshire,
and in 1750 to the archdeaconry of Winchester. In 1753 he was
collated to the rectory of East Woodhay, Hampshire, and in the
same year he published his lectures on Hebrew poetry. In 1754
he received the degree of doctor of divinity from his university,
and in 1755 he went to Ireland for a short time as first chaplain
to the lord-lieutenant, the 4th duke of Devonshire. He declined
a presentation to the see of Limerick, but accepted a prebendal
stall at Durham and the rectory of Sedgefield. In 1758 he
published his <i>Life of William of Wykeham</i>; this was followed
in 1762 by <i>A Short Introduction to English Grammar</i>. In 1765,
the year of his election into the Royal Societies of London and
Göttingen, he engaged in controversy with William Warburton
on the book of Job, in which he was held by Gibbon to have had
the advantage. In June 1766 Lowth was consecrated bishop of
St David&rsquo;s, and about four months afterwards he was translated
to Oxford, where he remained till 1777, when he became bishop
of London and dean of the Chapel Royal. In 1778 appeared his
last work, <i>Isaiah, a new Translation, with a Preliminary Dissertation,
and Notes, Critical, Philological, and Explanatory</i>.
He declined the archbishopric of Canterbury in 1783, and died
at Fulham on the 3rd of November 1787.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Praelectiones</i>, translated in 1787 by G. Gregory as <i>Lectures on
the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews</i>, exercised a great influence both in
England and on the continent. Their chief importance lay in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
idea of looking at the sacred poetry as poetry, and examining it by
the ordinary standards of literary criticism. Lowth&rsquo;s aesthetic criticism
was that of the age, and is now in great part obsolete, a more
natural method having been soon after introduced by Herder.
The principal point in which Lowth&rsquo;s influence has been lasting is his
doctrine of poetic parallelism, and even here his somewhat mechanical
classification of the forms of Hebrew sense-rhythm, as it should
rather be called, is open to serious objections. Editions of the
<i>Lectures</i> and of the <i>Isaiah</i> have been numerous, and both have
been translated into German. A volume of <i>Sermons and other
Remains</i>, with memoir by the topographer, Peter Hall (1802-1849),
was published in 1834, and an edition of the <i>Popular Works</i>
of Robert Lowth in 3 vols. appeared in 1843.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOYALISTS<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> or <span class="bold">TORIES,</span> in America, the name given to
the colonists who were loyal to Great Britain during the War
of Independence. In New England and the Middle Colonies
loyalism had a religious as well as a political basis. It represented
the Anglican as opposed to the Calvinistic influence.
With scarcely an exception the Anglican ministers were ardent
Loyalists, the writers and pamphleteers were the ministers
and teachers of that faith, and virtually all the military or civil
leaders were members of that church. The Loyalists north
of Maryland represented the old Tory traditions. In the southern
colonies, where Anglicanism predominated, the division did not
follow religious lines so closely. In Virginia and South Carolina
the Whig leaders were almost without exception members of
the established church. Out of twenty Episcopal ministers
in South Carolina only five were Loyalists. Although many of
the wealthy Anglican planters of the tide-water section fought
for the mother country, the Tories derived their chief support
from the non-Anglican Germans and Scotch in the upper country.
The natural leaders in these colonies were members of the same
church as the governor and vied with him in their zeal for the
support of that church. Since religion was not an issue, the
disputes over questions purely political in character, such as
taxation, distribution of land and appointment of officials,
were all the more bitter. The settlers on the frontier were
snubbed both socially and politically by the low-country aristocracy,
and in North Carolina and South Carolina were denied
courts of justice and any adequate representation in the colonial
assembly. Naturally they refused to follow such leaders in a
war in defence of principles in which they had no material
interest. They did not drink tea and had little occasion for the
use of stamps, since they were not engaged in commerce and
had no courts in which to use legal documents. The failure
of the British officers to realize that conditions in the south
differed from those in the north, and the tendency on their
part to treat all Dissenters as rebels, were partly responsible
for the ultimate loss of their southern campaign. The Scotch-Irish
in the south, influenced perhaps by memories of commercial
and religious oppression in Ulster, were mostly in sympathy
with the American cause.</p>

<p>Taking the Thirteen Colonies as a whole, loyalism drew its
strength largely from the following classes: (1) the official
class&mdash;men holding positions in the civil, military and naval
services, and their immediate families and social connexions,
as, for example, Lieutenant-Governor Bull in South Carolina,
Governor Dunmore in Virginia and Governor Tryon in New
York; (2) the professional classes&mdash;lawyers, physicians, teachers
and ministers, such as Benjamin Kissam, Peter Van Schaack
and Dr Azor Betts of New York and Dr Myles Cooper, president
of King&rsquo;s College (now Columbia University); (3) large landed
proprietors and their tenants, <i>e.g.</i> William Wragg in South
Carolina and the De Lanceys, De Peysters and Van Cortlandts
in New York; (4) the wealthy commercial classes in New York,
Albany, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Charleston, whose business
interests would be affected by war; (5) natural conservatives
of the type of Joseph Galloway of Pennsylvania, and numerous
political trimmers and opportunists. Before 1776 the Loyalists
may be divided into two groups. There was a minority of
extremists led by the Anglican ministers and teachers, who
favoured an unquestioning obedience to all British legislation.
The moderate majority disapproved of the mother country&rsquo;s
unwise colonial policy and advocated opposition to it through
legally organized bodies. Many even sanctioned non-importation
and non-exportation agreements, and took part in the election
of delegates to the First Continental Congress. The aggressive
attitude of Congress, the subsequent adoption of the Declaration
of Independence, and the refusal to consider Lord Howe&rsquo;s
conciliatory propositions finally forced them into armed opposition.
Very few really sanctioned the British policy as a whole, but
all felt that it was their first duty to fight for the preservation
of the empire and to leave constitutional questions for a later
settlement. John Adams&rsquo;s estimate that one-third of all the
people in the thirteen states in 1776 were Loyalists was perhaps
approximately correct. In New England the number was small,
perhaps largest in Connecticut and in the district which afterwards
became the state of Vermont. New York was the chief
stronghold. The &ldquo;De Lancey party&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Episcopalian
party&rdquo; included the majority of the wealthy farmers, merchants
and bankers, and practically all communicants of the Anglican
church. New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and
Virginia contained large and influential Loyalist minorities; North
Carolina was about equally divided; South Carolina probably,
and Georgia certainly, had Loyalist majorities. Some of the
Loyalists joined the regular British army, others organized
guerilla bands and with their Indian allies inaugurated a reign
of terror on the frontier from New York to Georgia. New
York alone furnished about 15,000 Loyalists to the British army
and navy, and about 8500 militia, making in all 23,500 Loyalist
troops. This was more than any other colony supplied, perhaps
more than all the others combined. Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Loyal Greens&rdquo;
and Butler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tory Rangers&rdquo; served under General St Leger
in the Burgoyne campaign of 1777, and the latter took part in
the Wyoming and Cherry Valley massacres of 1778. The
strength of these Loyalists in arms was weakened in New York
by General Sullivan&rsquo;s success at Newtown (now Elmira) on the
29th of August 1779, and broken in the north-west by George
Rogers Clark&rsquo;s victories at Kaskaskia and Vincennes in 1778 and
1779, and in the south by the battles of King&rsquo;s Mountain and
Cowpens in 1780. Severe laws were passed against the Loyalists
in all the states. They were in general disfranchised and forbidden
to hold office or to practise law. Eight of the states formally
banished certain prominent Tories either conditionally or unconditionally,
and the remaining five, Connecticut, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, did practically the same
indirectly. Social and commercial ostracism forced many
others to flee. Their property was usually confiscated for the
support of the American cause. They went to England, to the
West Indies, to the Bahamas, to Canada and to New York,
Newport, Charleston and other cities under British control.
According to a trustworthy estimate 60,000 persons went into
exile during the years from 1775 to 1787. The great majority
settled in Nova Scotia and in Upper and Lower Canada, where
they and their descendants became known as &ldquo;United Empire
Loyalists.&rdquo; Those who remained in the United States suffered
for many years, and all the laws against them were not finally
repealed until after the War of 1812. The British government,
however, endeavoured to look after the interests of its loyal
colonists. During the war a number of the prominent Loyalists
(<i>e.g.</i> Joseph Galloway) were appointed to lucrative positions,
and rations were issued to many Loyalists in the cities, such as
New York, which were held by the British. During the peace
negotiations at Paris the treatment of the Loyalists presented
a difficult problem, Great Britain at first insisting that the
United States should agree to remove their disabilities and to
act toward them in a spirit of conciliation. The American
commissioners, knowing that a treaty with such provisions would
not be accepted at home, and that the general government had,
moreover, no power to bind the various states in such a matter,
refused to accede; but in the treaty, as finally ratified, the United
States agreed (by Article V.) to recommend to the legislatures
of the various states that Loyalists should &ldquo;have free liberty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
to go to any part or parts of any of the thirteen United States,
and therein to remain twelve months, unmolested in their endeavours
to obtain the restitution of such of their estates, rights
and properties as may have been confiscated,&rdquo; that acts and
laws in the premises be reconsidered and revised, and that
restitution of estates, &amp;c., should be made. The sixth article
provided &ldquo;that there shall be no future confiscations made,
nor any prosecutions commenced against any person&rdquo; for
having taken part in the war; and that those in confinement
on such charges should be liberated. In Great Britain opponents
of the government asserted that the Loyalists had virtually
been betrayed; in America the treaty aroused opposition
as making too great concessions to them. Congress made
the promised recommendations, but they were unheeded by the
various states, in spite of the advocacy by Alexander Hamilton
and others of a conciliatory treatment of the Loyalists; and
Great Britain, in retaliation, refused until 1796 to evacuate
the western posts as the treaty prescribed. Immediately after
the war parliament appointed a commission of five to examine
the claims of the Loyalists for compensation for services and
losses; and to satisfy these claims and to establish Loyalists
in Nova Scotia and Canada the British government expended
fully £6,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOYALTY,<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> allegiance to the sovereign or established government
of one&rsquo;s country, also personal devotion and reverence
to the sovereign and royal family. The English word came into
use in the early part of the 15th century in the sense of fidelity
to one&rsquo;s oath, or in service, love, &amp;c.; the later and now the
ordinary sense appears in the 16th century. The O. Fr. <i>loialtê</i>,
mod. <i>loyauté</i>, is formed from <i>loial</i>, loyal, Scots <i>leal</i>, Lat. <i>legalis</i>,
legal, from <i>lex</i>, law. This was used in the special feudal sense
of one who has full legal rights, a <i>legalis homo</i> being opposed to
the <i>exlex</i>, <i>utlegatus</i>, or outlaw. Thence in the sense of faithful,
it meant one who kept faithful allegiance to his feudal lord,
and so loyal in the accepted use of the word.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOYALTY ISLANDS<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (Fr. <i>Iles Loyalty</i> or <i>Loyauté</i>), a group
in the South Pacific Ocean belonging to France, about 100 m.
E. of New Caledonia, with a total land area of about 1050 sq. m.
and 20,000 inhabitants. It consists of Uea or Uvea (the northernmost),
Lifu (the largest island, with an area of 650 sq. m.), Tiga
and several small islands and Maré or Nengone. They are coral
islands of comparatively recent elevation, and in no place rise
more than 250 ft. above the level of the sea. Enough of the
rocky surface is covered with a thin coating of soil to enable
the natives to grow yams, taro, bananas, &amp;c., for their support;
cotton thrives well, and has even been exported in small
quantities, but there is no space available for its cultivation
on any considerable scale. Fresh water, rising and falling with
the tide, is found in certain large caverns in Lifu, and by sinking
to the sea-level a supply may be obtained in any part of the
island. The chief product of the islands are bananas; the chief
export sandal-wood.</p>

<p>The Loyalty islanders are Melanesians; the several islands have
each its separate language, and in Uea one tribe uses a Samoan
and another a New Hebridean form of speech. The Loyalty
group was discovered at the beginning of the 19th century, and
Dumont d&rsquo;Urville laid down the several islands in his chart.
For many years the natives had a reputation as dangerous
cannibals, but they are now among the most civilized Melanesians.
Christianity was introduced into Maré by native teachers from
Rarotonga and Samoa; missionaries were settled by the London
Missionary Society at Maré in 1854, at Lifu in 1859 and at Uea
in 1865: Roman Catholic missionaries also arrived from New
Caledonia; and in 1864 the French, considering the islands a
dependency of that colony, formally instituted a commandant.
An attempt was made by this official to put a stop to the English
missions by violence; but the report of his conduct led to so
much indignation in Australia and in England that the emperor
Napoleon, on receipt of a protest from Lord Shaftesbury and
others, caused a commission of inquiry to be appointed and
free liberty of worship to be secured to the Protestant missions.
A further persecution of Christians in Uea, during 1875, called
forth a protest from the British government.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOYOLA, ST IGNATIUS OF<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (1491-1556), founder of the
Society of Jesus. Inigo Lopez de Recalde, son of Beltran,
lord of the noble houses of Loyola and Oñaz, was born, according
to the generally accepted opinion, on the 24th of December
1491 at the castle of Loyola, which is situated on the river
Urola, about 1 m. from the town of Azpeitia, in the province of
Guipuzcoa. He was the youngest of a family of thirteen. As
soon as he had learnt the elements of reading and writing, he was
sent as a page to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella; afterwards,
until his twenty-sixth year, he took service with Antonio
Maurique, duke of Nagera, and followed the career of arms. He
was free in his relations with women, gambled and fought;
but he also gave indications of that courage, constancy and
prudence which marked his after life. In a political mission to
settle certain disputes in the province he showed his dexterity
in managing men.</p>

<p>Despite the treaty of Noyon (1516), Charles V. kept Pampeluna,
the capital of Navarre. André de Foix, at the head of the French
troops, laid siege to the town in 1521 and Ignatius was one of the
defending garrison. In the hour of danger, the claims of religion
reasserted themselves on the young soldier, and, following a
custom when no priest was at hand, he made his confession to a
brother officer, who in turn also confessed to him. During the
final assault on the 19th of May 1521 a cannon ball struck him,
shattering one of his legs and badly wounding the other. The
victorious French treated him kindly for nearly two weeks,
and then sent him in a litter to Loyola. The doctors declared
that the leg needed to be broken and set again; and the operation
was borne without a sign of pain beyond a clenching of his fist.
His vanity made him order the surgeons to cut out a bone which
protruded below the knee and spoilt the symmetry of his leg.
He was lame for the rest of his days. Serious illness followed
the operations, and, his life being despaired of, he received the
last sacraments on the 28th of June. That night, however, he
began to mend, and in a few days he was out of danger. During
convalescence two books that were to influence his life were
brought to him. These were a Castilian translation of <i>The Life
of Christ</i> by Ludolphus of Saxony, and the popular <i>Flowers of the
Saints</i>, a series of pious biographies. He gradually became
interested in these books, and a mental struggle began. Sometimes
he would pass hours thinking of a certain illustrious lady,
devising means of seeing her and of doing deeds that would win
her favour; at other times the thoughts suggested by the books
got the upper hand. He began to recognize that his career of
arms was over: so he would become the knight of Christ. He
determined to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and to practise
all the austerities that he read of in <i>The Flowers of the Saints</i>.
Expiating his sins was not so much his aim as to accomplish
great deeds for God. During the struggle that went on in his soul,
he began to take note of his psychological state; and this was
the first time that he exercised his reason on spiritual things;
the experience thus painfully gained he found of great use afterwards
in directing others. One night while he lay awake, he
tells us, he saw the likeness of the Blessed Virgin with her
divine Son; and immediately a loathing seized him for the
former deeds of his life, especially for those relating to carnal
desires; and he asserts that for the future he never yielded to any
such desires. This was the first of many visions. Ignatius
proposed after returning from Jerusalem to join the Carthusian
order at Seville as a lay brother. About the same time Martin
Luther was in the full course of his protest against the papal
supremacy and had already burnt the pope&rsquo;s bull at Worms. The
two opponents were girding themselves for the struggle; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
what the Church of Rome was losing by the defection of the
Augustinian was being counterbalanced by the conversion of
the founder of the Society of Jesus.</p>

<p>As soon as Ignatius had regained strength, he started ostensibly
to rejoin the duke of Nagera, but in reality to visit the great
Benedictine abbey of Montserrato, a famous place of pilgrimage.
On the way, he was joined by a Moor, who began to jest at some
of the Christian doctrines, especially at the perpetual virginity
of the Blessed Virgin. Ignatius was no controversialist; and
the Moor rode off victorious. The chivalrous nature of Ignatius
was aroused. Seized with a longing to pursue and kill the Moor
on account of his insulting language, Ignatius, still doubting
as to his best course, left the matter to his mule, which at the
dividing of the ways took the path to the abbey, leaving the
open road which the Moor had taken. Before reaching Montserrato,
Ignatius purchased some sackcloth for a garment and
hempen shoes, which, with a staff and gourd, formed the usual
pilgrim&rsquo;s dress. Approaching the abbey he resolved to do as
his favourite hero Amadis de Gaul did&mdash;keep a vigil all night
before the Lady altar and then lay aside his worldly armour to
put on that of Christ. He arrived at the abbey just about the
feast of St Benedict (the 21st of March 1522), and there made a
confession of his life to a priest belonging to the monastery.
He found in use for the pilgrims a translation of the <i>Spiritual
Exercises</i> of the former abbot, Garcia di Cisneros (d. 1510);
and this book evidently gave Ignatius the first idea of his more
famous work under the same title. Leaving his mule to the
abbey, and giving away his worldly clothes to a beggar, he kept
his watch in the church during the night of the 24th-25th of
March, and placed on the Lady altar his sword and dagger.
Early the next morning he received the Holy Eucharist and
left before any one could recognize him, going to the neighbouring
town of Manresa, where he first lived in the hospice. Here
began a series of heavy spiritual trials which assailed him for
many months. Seven hours a day he spent on his knees in prayer
and three times a day he scourged his emaciated body. One day,
almost overcome with scruples, he was tempted to end his
miseries by suicide. At another time, for the same reason, he
kept an absolute fast for a week. He tells us that, at this time,
God wrought with him as a master with a schoolboy whom he
teaches. But his energies were not confined to himself. He
assisted others who came to him for spiritual advice; and seeing
the fruit reaped from helping his neighbour, he gave up the
extreme severities in which he had delighted and began to take
more care of his person, so as not needlessly to offend those
whom he might influence for good.</p>

<p>During his stay at Manresa, he lived for the most part in a
cell at the Dominican convent; and here, evidently, he had
severe illnesses. He recounts the details of at least two of these
attacks, but says nothing about the much-quoted swoon of
eight days, during which he is supposed to have seen in vision
the scheme of the future Society. Neither does he refer in any
way to the famous cave in which, according to the Ignatian
myth, the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> were written. Fortunately we
have the first-hand evidence of his autobiography, which is a
surer guide than the lines written by untrustworthy disciples.
Ignatius remained at Manresa for about a year, and in the spring
of 1523 set out for Barcelona on his way to Rome, where he
arrived on Palm Sunday. After two weeks he left, having
received the blessing of Pope Adrian VI., and proceeded by
Padua to Venice, where he begged his bread and slept in the
Piazza di San Marco until a rich Spaniard gave him shelter
and obtained an order from the doge for a passage in a pilgrim
ship bound for Cyprus, whence he could get to Jaffa. In due
course Ignatius arrived at Jerusalem, where he intended to
remain, in order continuously to visit the holy places and help
souls. For this end he had obtained letters of recommendation
to the guardian, to whom, however, he only spoke of his desire
of satisfying his devotion, not hinting his other motive. The
Franciscans gave him no encouragement to remain; and the
provincial threatened him with excommunication if he persisted.
Not only had the friars great difficulty in supporting themselves,
but they dreaded an outbreak from the fanatical Turks who
resented some imprudent manifestations of Loyola&rsquo;s zeal.
Ignatius returned to Venice in the middle of January 1524;
and, determining to devote himself for a while to study, he set
out for Barcelona, where he arrived in Lent. Here he consulted
Isabella Roser, a lady of high rank and piety, and also the master
of a grammar school. These both approved his plan; the one
promised to teach him without payment and the other to provide
him with the necessaries of life. Here, in his thirty-third year,
he began to learn Latin, and after two years his master urged
him to go to Alcalá to begin philosophy. During his stay of a
year and a half in this university, besides his classes, he found
occasion to give to some companions his <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> in
the form they had then taken and certain instructions in Christian
doctrine. On account of these discourses Ignatius came into
conflict with the Inquisition. He and his companions were
denounced as belonging to the sects of <i>Sagati</i> and <i>Illuminati</i>.
Their mode of life and dress was peculiar and hinted at innovation.
But, always ready to obey authority, Ignatius was able to disarm
any charges that, now and at other times, were brought against
him. The Inquisition merely advised him and his companions
to dress in a less extraordinary manner and to go shod. Four
months later he was suddenly cast into prison; and, after
seventeen days, he learnt that he was falsely accused of
sending two noble ladies on a pilgrimage to Jaen. During
their absence, from the 21st of April 1527 to the 1st of June,
he remained in prison, and was then set free with a prohibition
against instructing others until he had spent four years in study.</p>

<p>Seeing his way thus barred at Alcalá, he went with his
companions to Salamanca. Here the Dominicans, doubting the
orthodoxy of the new-comers, had them put into prison, where
they were chained foot to foot and fastened to a stake set up in
the middle of the cell. Some days afterwards Ignatius was
examined and found without fault. His patience won him many
friends; and when he and his companions remained in prison
while the other prisoners managed to escape, their conduct
excited much admiration. After twenty-two days they were
called up to receive sentence. No fault was found in their life
and teaching; but they were forbidden to define any sins as
being mortal or venial until they had studied for four years.
Hampered again by such an order, Ignatius determined to go
to Paris to continue his studies. Up to the present he was far
from having any idea of founding a society. The only question
before him now was whether he should join an order, or continue
his wandering existence. He decided upon Paris for the present,
and before leaving Salamanca he agreed with his companions
that they should wait where they were until he returned; for
he only meant to see whether he could find any means by which
they all might give themselves to study. He left Barcelona and,
travelling on foot to Paris, he arrived there in February 1528.
The university of Paris had reached its zenith at the time
of the council of Constance (1418), and was now losing its
intellectual leadership under the attacks of the Renaissance and
the Reformation. In 1521 the university had condemned
Luther&rsquo;s <i>Babylonish Captivity</i>, and in 1527 Erasmus&rsquo;s <i>Colloquies</i>
met with the same fate. Soon after his arrival, Ignatius may
have seen in the Place de Grève the burning of Louis de Berquin
for heresy.<a name="fa1w" id="fa1w" href="#ft1w"><span class="sp">1</span></a> At this period there were between twelve and
fifteen thousand students attending the university, and the
life was an extraordinary mixture of licentiousness and devout
zeal. When Ignatius arrived in Paris, he lodged at first with
some fellow-countrymen; and for two years attended the
lectures on humanities at the collège de Montaigu, supporting
himself at first by the charity of Isabella Roser; but, a fellow-lodger
defrauding him of his stock, he found himself destitute
and compelled to beg his bread. He retired to the hospice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
of St Jacques; and, following the advice of a Spanish monk,
spent his vacations in Flanders, where he was helped by the
rich Spanish merchants. At Bruges he became acquainted with
the famous Spanish scholar, Juan Luis Vives, with whom he
lodged. In the summer of 1530 he went to London, where he
received alms more abundantly than elsewhere. As he could
only support himself at Paris with difficulty, it was impossible
to send for his companions in Salamanca. Others, however,
joined him in Paris, and to some of them he gave the <i>Spiritual
Exercises</i>, with the result that the Inquisition made him give up
speaking on religious subjects during the time he was a student.
At the end of 1529 he came into contact with the men who were
eventually to become the first fathers of the Society of Jesus.
He won over the Savoyard Pierre Lefèvre (Faber), whose room
he shared, and the Navarrese Francis Xavier, who taught
philosophy in the college of St Barbara. Afterwards he became
acquainted with the young Castilian, Diego Laynez, who had
heard of him at Acalá and found him out in Paris. With
Laynez came two other young men, the Toledan Alfonso Salmeron
and the Portuguese Simon Rodriguez. Nicholas Bobadilla,
a poor Spaniard who had finished his studies, was the next to
join him. The little company of seven determined to consecrate
their union by vows. On the 15th of August 1534, the Feast
of the Assumption, they assembled in the crypt of the church
of St Mary on Montmartre, and Faber, the only one who was a
priest, said Mass. They then took the vows of poverty and
chastity, and pledged themselves to go to the Holy Land as
missionaries or for the purpose of tending the sick; or if this
design should prove impracticable, to go to Rome and place
themselves at the disposal of the pope for any purpose. But,
whatever may have been the private opinion of Ignatius, there
was on this occasion no foundation of any society. The vows
were individual obligations which could be kept quite apart from
membership in a society. A provision was made that if, after
waiting a year at Venice, they were unable to go to Jerusalem,
this part of the vow should be cancelled and they should at
once betake themselves to Rome.</p>

<p>At this time Ignatius was again suffering from his former
imprudent austerities; and he was urged to return for a while
to his native air. He left Paris for Spain in the autumn of 1535,
leaving Faber in charge of his companions to finish their studies.
During the absence of Ignatius, Faber gained three more
adherents. But before leaving Paris Ignatius heard once more
that complaints had been lodged against him at the Inquisition;
but these like the others were found to be without any foundation.
When he arrived near Loyola he would not go to the castle, but
lived at the public hospice at Azpeitia, and began his usual life
of teaching Christian doctrine and reforming morals. Falling
ill again he went to other parts of Spain to transact business for
his companions. Then, sailing from Valencia to Genoa, he made
his way to Venice, where he arrived during the last days of 1535.
Here he waited for a year until his companions could join him,
and meanwhile he occupied himself in his usual good works,
gaining several more companions and meeting Giovanni Piero
Caraffa, afterwards Paul IV., who had lately founded the
Theatines. What happened between the two does not appear;
but henceforth Caraffa seems to have borne ill will towards
Ignatius and his companions. At Venice Ignatius was again
accused of heresy, and it was said that he had escaped from the
Inquisition in Spain and had been burnt in effigy at Paris. These
charges he met successfully by insisting that the nuncio should
thoroughly inquire into the matter.</p>

<p>After a journey of fifty-four days his companions arrived at
Venice in January 1537; and here they remained until the
beginning of Lent, when Ignatius sent them to Rome to get
money for the proposed voyage to Palestine. He himself stayed
behind, as he feared that, if he went with them, Caraffa at Rome,
together with Dr Ortiz, a German opponent in Paris and now
Charles V.&rsquo;s ambassador at the Vatican, would prejudice the
pope against them. But Ortiz proved a friend and presented
them to Paul III., who gave them leave to go to Palestine to
preach the Gospel, bestowing upon them abundant alms. He
likewise gave licence for those not yet priests to be ordained by
any catholic bishop on the title of poverty. They had returned
to Venice where Ignatius and the others were ordained priests
on the 24th of June 1537, after having renewed their vows of
poverty and chastity to the legate Verallo. Ignatius, now a
priest, waited for eighteen months before saying Mass, which he
did for the first time on the 25th of December 1538 in the church
of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.</p>

<p>The year of waiting passed away without any chance of going
to the Holy Land. Finding it impossible to keep this part of
their vow, the fathers met at Vicenza, where Ignatius was staying
in a ruined monastery; and here after deliberation it was determined
that he, Laynez and Faber should go to Rome to place
the little band at the disposal of the pope. It was now that the
Society began to take some visible form. A common rule was
devised and a name adopted. Ignatius declared that having
assembled in the name of Jesus, the association should henceforth
bear the name of the &ldquo;Company of Jesus.&rdquo; The word used
shows Loyola&rsquo;s military ideal of the duties and methods of the
nascent society.</p>

<p>On the road to Rome a famous vision took place, as to which
we have the evidence of Ignatius himself. In a certain church,
a few miles before Rome, whilst in prayer he was aware of a
stirring and a change in his soul; and so openly did he see God
the Father placing him with Christ, that he could not dare to
doubt that God the Father had so placed him. Subsequent
writers add that Christ, looking at him with a benign countenance,
said: &ldquo;I shall be propitious to you&rdquo;; while others add the
significant words, &ldquo;at Rome.&rdquo; Ignatius, however, says nothing
about so important a matter; indeed he understood the vision
to mean that many things would be adverse to them, and told
his companions when they reached the city that he saw the
windows there closed against him. He also said: &ldquo;We must of
necessity proceed with caution; and we must not make the
acquaintance of women unless they be of very high rank.&rdquo;
They arrived in Rome in October 1537; and lived at first in a
little cottage in a vineyard and near the Trinità dei Monti. The
pope appointed Faber to teach Holy Scripture, and Laynez
scholastic theology, in the university of the Sapienza. Ignatius
was left free to carry on his spiritual work, which became so large
that he was obliged to call his other companions to Rome.
During the absence of the pope, a certain hermit began to spread
heresy and was opposed by Ignatius and his companions. In
revenge the hermit brought up the former accusations concerning
the relations to the Inquisition, and proclaimed Ignatius and his
friends to be false, designing men and no better than concealed
heretics. The matter was examined and the legate ordered the
suit to be quashed. But this did not suit Ignatius. It was
necessary for his own good repute and the future of his work that
a definitive sentence should be pronounced and his name cleared
once and for all. The legate demurred; but on the pope&rsquo;s
return sentence was formally given in his favour.</p>

<p>The life of Ignatius is now mainly identified with the formation
and growth of his Society (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jesuits</a></span>), but his zeal found other
outlets in Rome. He founded institutions for rescuing fallen
women, started orphanages and organized catechetical instructions.
He obtained, after difficulty, the official recognition of
his Society from Paul III. on the 27th of September 1540, and
successfully steered it through many perils that beset it in its
early days. He was unanimously elected the first general in
April 1541; and on the 22nd of that month received the first
vows of the Society in the church of San Paolo <i>fuori la mura</i>.
Two works now chiefly occupied the remainder of his life: the
final completion of the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> and the drawing up of
the <i>Constitutions</i>, which received their final form after his death.
These two are so constantly connected that the one cannot be
understood without the other. The <i>Constitutions</i> are discussed
in the article on the Jesuits. In these he taught his followers to
respond to the call; by the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> he moulded their
character.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Book of the Spiritual Exercises</i> has been one of the world-moving
books. In its strict conception it is only an application of the Gospel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
precepts to the individual soul. Its object is to convince a man of
sin, of justice and of judgment. The idea of the book is not original
to Ignatius At Montserrato he had found in use a popular translation
of the <i>Exercitatorio de la vida spiritual</i> (1500), written in Latin
by Abbot Garcias de Cisneros (d. 1510), and divided into three ways
or periods during which purity of soul, enlightenment and union
are to be worked for; a fourth part is added on contemplation.
This book evidently afforded the root idea of the Ignatian and more
famous book. But the differences are great. While taking the title,
the idea of division by periods and the subjects of most of the meditations
from the older work, Ignatius skilfully adapted it to his own
requirements. Above all the methods of the two are essentially
different. The Benedictine work follows the old monastic tradition
of the direct intercourse of the soul with God. Ignatius, with his
military instinct and views of obedience, intervenes with a director
who gives the exercises to the person who in turn receives them.
If this introduction of the director is essential to the end for which
Ignatius framed his <i>Exercises</i>, in it we also find dangers. A director,
whose aim is only the personal advantage of the one who is receiving
the exercises, will be the faithful interpreter of his founder&rsquo;s intentions:
but in the case of one whose <i>esprit de corps</i> is unbalanced,
the temporary and pecuniary advantage of the Society may be
made of more importance than that of the exercitant. Another
danger may come when minuteness of direction takes away the
wholesome sense of responsibility. Apart from these abuses the
<i>Spiritual Exercises</i> have proved their value over and over again,
and have received the sincerest form of flattery in countless imitations.
The original parts of the book are principally to be found in
the meditations, which are clearly Ignatian in conception as well as
method. These are <i>The Reign of Christ</i>, wherein Christ as an earthly
king calls his subjects to war: and <i>Two Standards</i>, one of Jesus Christ
and the other of Lucifer. Besides these there are various additions
to the series of meditations, which are mostly the practical results
of the experiences which Ignatius went through in the early stages
of his conversion. He gives various methods of prayer; methods of
making an election; his series of rules for the discernment of spirits;
rules for the distribution of alms and the treatment of scruples;
tests of orthodoxy. These additions are skilfully worked into the
series of meditations; so that when the exercitant by meditation
has moved his soul to act, here are practical directions at hand.</p>

<p>The exercises are divided into four series of meditations technically
called &ldquo;weeks,&rdquo; each of which may last as long as the director considers
necessary to achieve the end for which each week is destined.
But the whole period is generally concluded in the space of a month.
The first week is the foundation, and has to do with the consideration
of the end of man, sin, death, judgment and hell. Having purified
the soul from sin and obtained a detestation thereof, the second week
treats of the kingdom of Christ, and is meant to lead the soul to
make an election of the service of God. The third and fourth weeks
are intended to confirm the soul in the new way chosen, to teach
how difficulties can be overcome, to inflame it with the love of God
and to help it to persevere.</p>

<p><i>The Book of the Spiritual Exercises</i> was not written at Manresa,
although there is in that place an inscription testifying to the supposed
fact. Ignatius was constantly adding to his work as his own
personal experience increased, and as he watched the effects of his
method on the souls of those to whom he gave the exercises. The
latest critics, even those of the Society itself, give 1548 as the date
when the book received its final touches; though Father Roothaan
gives Rome, the 9th of July 1541, as the date at the end of the ancient
MS. version. Ignatius wrote originally in Spanish, but the book was
twice translated into Latin during his lifetime. The more elegant
version (known as the common edition) differs but slightly from the
Spanish. Francisco Borgia, while duke of Gandia, petitioned Paul
III. to have the book examined and approved. The pope appointed
censors for both translations, who found the work to be replete with
piety and holiness, highly useful and wholesome. Paul III. on receiving
this report confirmed it on the 31st of July 1548 by the breve
<i>Pastoralis officii cura</i>. This book, which is rightly called the spiritual
arm of the Society, was the first book published by the Jesuits.</p>
</div>

<p>The progress of the Society of Jesus in Loyola&rsquo;s lifetime was
rapid (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jesuits</a></span>). Having always had an attraction for a life
of prayer and retirement, in 1547 he tried to resign the generalship,
and again in 1550, but the fathers unanimously opposed the
project. One of his last trials was to see in 1556 the election as
pope of his old opponent Caraffa, who soon showed his intention
of reforming certain points in the Society that Ignatius considered
vital. But at this difficult crisis he never lost his peace of mind.
He said: &ldquo;If this misfortune were to fall upon me, provided it
happened without any fault of mine, even if the Society were to
melt away like salt in water, I believe that a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s
recollection in God would be sufficient to console me and to re-establish
peace within me.&rdquo; It is clear that Ignatius never
dreamed of putting his Society before the church nor of identifying
the two institutions.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1556 Ignatius grew very weak and resigned
the active government to three fathers, Polanco, Madrid and
Natal. Fever laid hold of him, and he died somewhat suddenly
on the 31st of July 1556, without receiving or asking for the last
sacraments. He was beatified in 1609 by Paul V. and canonized
in 1628 by Gregory XV. His body lies under the altar in the
north transept of the Gesù in Rome.</p>

<p>His portrait is well known. The olive complexion, a face
emaciated by austerities, the large forehead, the brilliant and
small eyes, the high bald head tell their own tale. He was of
medium height and carried himself so well that his lameness was
hardly noticeable. His character was naturally impetuous and
enthusiastic, but became marked with great self-control as he
gradually brought his will under his reason. There was always
that love of overcoming difficulty inherent in a chivalrous
nature; and this also accounts for that desire of surpassing
every one else that marked his early days. Whilst other Christians,
following St Paul, were content to do all things for the
glory of God, Ignatius set himself and his followers to strive after
the greater glory. Learning by his own experience and errors,
he wisely developed a sovereign prudence which nicely adjusted
means to the end in view. He impressed on his followers the
doctrine that in all things the end was to be considered. Never
would Ignatius have countenanced so perverted an idea as that the
end justified the means, for with his spiritual light and zeal for
God&rsquo;s glory he saw clearly that means in themselves unjust were
opposed to the very end he held in view. As a ruler he displayed
the same common sense. Obedience he made one of his great
instruments, yet he never intended it to be a galling yoke. His
doctrine on the subject is found in the well-known letter to the
Portuguese Jesuits in 1553, and if this be read carefully together
with the <i>Constitutions</i> his meaning is clear. If he says that a
subject is to allow himself to be moved and directed, under God,
by a superior just as though he were a corpse or as a staff in the
hands of an old man, he is also careful to say that the obedience
is only due in all things &ldquo;wherein it cannot be defined (as it is
said) that any kind of sin appears.&rdquo; The way in which his
teaching on obedience is practically carried out is the best corrective
of the false ideas that have arisen from misconceptions of
its nature. His high ideas on the subject made him a stern ruler.
There are certain instances in his life which, taken by themselves,
show a hardness in treating individuals who would not obey;
but as a rule, he tempered his authority to the capacity of those
with whom he had to deal. When he had to choose between the
welfare of the Society and the feelings of an individual it was
clear to which side the balance would fall.</p>

<p>There was in his character a peculiar mixture of conservatism
and a keen sense of the requirements of the day. In intellectual
matters he was not in advance of his day. The Jesuit system of
education, set forth in the <i>Ratio studiorum</i>, owes nothing to him.
While he did not reject any approved learning, he abhorred any
intellectual culture that destroyed or lessened piety. He wished
to secure uniformity in the judgment of the Society even in
points left open and free by the church: &ldquo;Let us all think in the
same way, let us all speak in the same manner if possible.&rdquo;
Bartole, the official biographer of Ignatius, says that he would
not permit any innovation in the studies; and that, were he
to live five hundred years, he would always repeat &ldquo;no novelties&rdquo;
in theology, in philosophy or in logic&mdash;not even in grammar.
The revival of learning had led many away from Christ; intellectual
culture must be used as a means of bringing them
back. The new learning in religion had divided Christendom;
the old learning of the faith, once delivered to the saints, was to
reconcile them. This was the problem that faced Ignatius,
and in his endeavour to effect a needed reformation in the
individual and in society his work and the success that crowned
it place him among the moral heroes of humanity.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The Ignatian literature is very large. Fortunately
we have in the <i>Acta quaedam</i> what is in effect the autobiography
of the saint. This has been translated into English under the title
of <i>The testament of Ignatius Loyola, being sundry acts of our Father
Ignatius, under God, the first founder of the Society of Jesus, taken down
from the Saint&rsquo;s own lips by Luis Gonzales</i> (London, 1900); and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
above account of Ignatius is taken in most places directly from this,
which is not only the best of all sources but also a valuable corrective
of the later and more imaginative works. Next to the <i>Acta quaedam</i>
comes in value Polanco&rsquo;s Vita Ignatii Loiolae, which is published in
the <i>Monumenta historica Societatis Jesu</i> now in progress. Polanco
was the saint&rsquo;s secretary towards the end of his life. Ribadeneira,
who as a youth had been associated with the founder, wrote his
<i>Vida del S. Ignacio de Loyola</i> (Madrid, 1594), based on an early
Latin work (Naples, 1572). Bartole, the official biographer, wrote
his <i>Della vita e dell&rsquo; instituto di S. Ignatio</i> (Rome, 1650, 1659);
Genelli wrote <i>Das Leben des heiligen Ignatius von Loyola</i> (Innsbruck,
1848); Nicolas Orlandinus gives a life in the first volume of the
<i>Historiae Societatis Jesu</i> (Rome, 1615). It would be impossible to
give a list even of the other lives, most of which are without value as
histories, being written mainly for edification. But the student may
be referred to the modern books Henri Joli&rsquo;s <i>St Ignace de Loyola</i>
(Paris, 1899), which is based on the best authorities, and to H.
Müller&rsquo;s curious <i>Les Origines de la Compagnie de Jésus</i> (Paris, 1898),
in which the author tries to establish a Mahommedan origin for
many of the ideas adopted by the saint.</p>

<p>The literature connected with the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> is also large.
It will be sufficient here to mention: <i>A Book of Spiritual Exercises,
written by Garcias de Cisneros</i> (London, 1876); the official Latin text
in the third volume of the Avignon edition of the <i>Constitutions</i>
(1830); Roothaan&rsquo;s <i>Exercitia spiritualia S. P. Ignatii de Loyola,
cum versione litterali ex autographo Hispanico, notis illustrata</i> (Namur,
1841); Diertino, <i>Historia exercitiorum S. P. Ignatii de Loyola</i> (1887).
Especially worthy of notice is P. Watrigant&rsquo;s <i>La Genèse des exercices
de Saint Ignace de Loyola</i>, republished from <i>Les Études</i> (20th May,
20th July, 20th October 1897).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOZENGE<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (from the Fr. <i>losenge</i>, or <i>losange</i>; the word also
appears in Span. <i>losanje</i>, and Ital. <i>losanga</i>; perhaps derived
from a word meaning a stone slab laid on a grave, which appears
in forms such as Provençal <i>lousa</i>, Span. <i>losa</i>, the ultimate origin
of which is unknown, the Lat. <i>lapis</i>, stone, or <i>laus</i>, praise, in the
sense of epitaph, have been suggested), properly a four equal-sided
figure, having two acute and two obtuse angles, a rhomb
or &ldquo;diamond.&rdquo; The figure is frequently used as a bearing in
heraldry and especially as a shield so shaped on which the arms
of a widow or spinster are emblazoned. It is used also to denote
the diamond-shaped facets of a precious stone when cut, also
the diamond panes of a casement window. In the 14th century
the &ldquo;lozenge pattern&rdquo; was a favourite design for decoration.
The word is also applied to a small tablet of sugar, originally
diamond shaped, containing either medical drugs or some
simple flavouring, or to a tablet of any concentrated substance,
such as a meat-lozenge. In the reign of James I. of Scotland
(1406-1437) a Scotch gold coin having a lozenge-shaped shield
with the arms of Scotland on the obverse side was called a
&ldquo;lozenge-lion.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOZÈRE,<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> a department of south-eastern France belonging
to the central plateau, composed of almost the whole of Gévaudan
and of some portions of the old dioceses of Uzès and Alais,
districts all formerly included in the province of Languedoc.
Pop. (1906) 128,016. Area, 1999 sq. m. It is bounded N. by
Cantal and Haute-Loire, E. by Ardèche and Gard, S. by Gard
and Aveyron and W. by Aveyron and Cantal. Lozère is mountainous
throughout and in average elevation is the highest of all
the French departments. It has three distinct regions&mdash;the
Cévennes proper to the south-east, the <i>causses</i> to the south-west
and the mountain tracts which occupy the rest of its area. The
Cévennes begin (within Lozère) with Mont Aigoual, which rises
to a height of more than 5100 ft.; parallel to this are the mountains
of Bougès, bold and bare on their southern face, but falling
gently with wooded slopes towards the Tarn which roughly
limits the Cévennes on the north. To the north of the Tarn is the
range of Lozère, including the peak of Finiels, the highest point
of the department (5584 ft.). Farther on occurs the broad
marshy plateau of Montbel, which drains southward to the
Lot, northwards to the Allier, eastward by the Chassezac to
the Ardèche. From this plateau extend the mountains of
La Margeride, undulating granitic tablelands partly clothed with
woods of oak, beech and fir, and partly covered with pastures,
to which flocks are brought from lower Languedoc in summer.
The highest point (Truc de Randon) reaches 5098 ft. Adjoining
the Margeride hills on the west is the volcanic range of Aubrac,
a pastoral district where horned cattle take the place of sheep;
the highest point is 4826 ft. The <i>causses</i> of Lozère, having an area
of about 564 sq. m., are calcareous, fissured and arid, but separated
from each other by deep and well-watered gorges, contrasting
with the desolate aspect of the plateaus. The <i>causse</i> of Sauveterre,
between the Lot and the Tarn, ranges from 3000 to 3300 ft.
in height; that of Méjan has nearly the same average altitude,
but has peaks some 1000 ft. higher. Between these two causses
the Tarn valley is among the most picturesque in France.
Lozère is watered entirely by rivers rising within its own boundaries,
being in this respect unique. The climate of Lozère varies
greatly with the locality. The mean temperature of Mende
(50° F.) is below that of Paris; that of the mountains is always
low, but on the <i>causses</i> the summer is scorching and the winter
severe; in the Cévennes the climate becomes mild enough at
their base (656 ft.) to permit the growth of the olive. Rain falls
in violent storms, causing disastrous floods. On the Mediterranean
versant there are 76 in., in the Garonne basin 46 and in
that of the Loire only 28. Sheep and cattle-rearing and cheese-making
are the chief occupations. Bees are kept, and, among
the Cévennes, silkworms. Large quantities of chestnuts are
exported from the Cévennes, where they form an important article
of diet. In the valley of the Lot wheat and fruit are the chief
products; elsewhere rye is the chief cereal, and oats, barley,
meslin and potatoes are also grown. Fruit trees and leguminous
plants are irrigated by small canals (<i>béals</i>) on terraces made and
maintained with much labour. Lead, zinc and antimony are
found. Saw-milling, the manufacture of wooden shoes and wool-spinning
are carried on; otherwise industries are few and
unimportant. Of mineral springs, those of Bagnols-les-Bains are
most frequented. The line of the Paris-Lyon company from
Paris to Nîmes traverses the eastern border of the department,
which is also served by the Midi railway with the line from
Neussargues to Béziers via Marvéjols. The arrondissements
are Mende, Florac and Marvéjols; the cantons number 24,
the communes 198. Lozère forms the diocese of Mende and part
of the ecclesiastical province of Albi. It falls within the region
of the XVI. army corps, the circumscriptions of the <i>académie</i>
(educational division) of Montpellier and the appeal court of
Nîmes. Mende (<i>q.v.</i>) is its most important town.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUANG-PRABANG,<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span> a town of French Indo-China, capital
of the Lao state of that name, on the left bank of the Me Kong
river. It lies at the foot of the pagoda hill which rises about
200 ft. above the plain on the promontory of land round which
the Nam Kan winds to the main river. It has a population of
about 9000 and contains the &ldquo;palace&rdquo; of the king of the state
and several pagodas. In 1887 it was taken and sacked by the
Haw or Black Flags, robber bands of Chinese soldiery, many
of them survivors of the Taiping rebellion. In 1893 Siam was
compelled to renounce her claims to the left bank of the Me
Kong, including Luang-Prabang and the magnificent highlands
of Chieng Kwang. That portion of the state which was on the
right bank of the Me Kong was not affected by the treaty, except
in so far as a portion of it fell within the sixteen miles&rsquo; zone
within which Siam agreed not to keep troops. Trade is in the
hands of Chinese or Shan traders; hill rice and other jungle
products are imported from the surrounding districts by the
Kha or hill people. The exports, which include rubber, gum
benjamin, silk, wax, sticklac, cutch, cardamon, a little ebony,
cinnamon, indigo, rhinoceros and deer horns, ivory and fish
roe, formerly all passed by way of Paklai to the Me Nam, and so
to Bangkok, but have now almost entirely ceased to follow
that route, the object of the French government being to deflect
the trade through French territory. Luang-Prabang is the
terminus of navigation on the upper Me Kong and the centre
of trade thereon.</p>

of Pampanga, Luzon, Philippine Islands, about 30 m. N.W. of
Manila. Pop. (1903) 19,063. Lubao is served by the Manila &amp;
Dagupan railway, and has water communication with Manila
by tidal streams and Manila Bay. Its products are, therefore,
readily marketed. It lies in a low, fertile plain, suited to the
growing of rice and sugar. Many of the inhabitants occupy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
themselves in the neighbouring nipa swamps, either preparing
the nipa leaves for use in house construction, or distilling &ldquo;nipa-wine&rdquo;
from the juice secured by tapping the blossom stalks.
The language is Pampangan.</p>

Brandenburg, on the Spree, 47 m. S.S.E. of Berlin, on the railway
to Görlitz. Pop. (1905) 7173. It is the chief town of the
Spreewald, and has saw-mills and manufactories of hosiery,
shoes and paper, and is famous for its <i>gurken</i>, or small pickling
cucumbers. The poet Paul Gerhardt (1607-1676) was pastor
here and is buried in the parish church.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÜBECK,<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> a state and city (<i>Freie und Hansestadt Lübeck</i>)
of Germany. The <i>principality</i> of Lübeck, lying north of the
state, is a constituent of the grand-duchy of Oldenburg (<i>q.v.</i>).
The state is situated on an arm of the Baltic between Holstein
and Mecklenburg-Schwerin. It consists of the city of Lübeck,
the town of Travemünde, 49 villages and the country districts,
embraces 115 sq. m. of territory, and had a population in 1907 of
109,265, of which 93,978 were included in the city and its immediate
suburbs. The state lies in the lowlands of the Baltic, is diversified
by gently swelling hills, and watered by the Trave and its
tributaries, the Wakenitz and the Stecknitz. The soil is fertile,
and, with the exception of forest land (14% of the whole area),
is mostly devoted to market gardening. Trade is centred in
the city of Lübeck.</p>

<p>The constitution of the free state is republican, and, by the
fundamental law of 1875, amended in 1905 and again in 1907,
consists of two assemblies. (1) The Senate of fourteen members,
of whom eight must belong to the learned professions, and six
of these again must be jurists, while of the remaining six, five
must be merchants. The Senate represents the sovereignty of
the state and is presided over by the <i>Oberbürgermeister</i>, who during
his two years&rsquo; term of office bears the title of &ldquo;magnificence.&rdquo;
(2) The House of Burgesses (Bürgerschaft), of 120 members,
elected by free suffrage and exercising its powers partly in
its collective capacity and partly through a committee of thirty
members. Purely commercial matters are dealt with by the
chamber of commerce, composed of a <i>praeses</i>, eighteen members
and a secretary. This body controls the exchange and appoints
brokers, shipping agents and underwriters. The executive
is in the hands of the Senate, but the House of Burgesses has the
right of initiating legislation, including that relative to foreign
treaties; the sanction of both chambers is required to the
passing of any new law. Lübeck has a court of first instance
(<i>Amtsgericht</i>) and a high court of justice (<i>Landgericht</i>); from
the latter appeals lie to the Hanseatic court of appeal (<i>Oberlandesgericht</i>)
at Hamburg, and from this again to the supreme court
of the empire (<i>Reichsgericht</i>) in Leipzig. The people are nearly
all Lutherans, and education is compulsory between the ages
of six and fourteen.</p>

<p>The estimated revenue for the year 1908-1909 amounted to
about £650,000, and the expenditure to a like sum. The public
debt amounted, in 1908, to about £2,518,000. Lübeck has one
vote in the federal council (<i>Bundesrat</i>) of the German Empire,
and sends one representative to the imperial parliament
(<i>Reichstag</i>).</p>

<p><i>History of the Constitution.</i>&mdash;At the first rise of the town justice
was administered to the inhabitants by the <i>Vogt</i> (<i>advocatus</i>) of
the count of Holstein. Simultaneously with its incorporation
by Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, who presented the city
with its own mint toll and market, there appears a magistracy
of six, chosen probably by the <i>Vogt</i> from the <i>Schöffen</i> (<i>scabini,
probi homines</i>). The members of the town council had to be
freemen, born in lawful wedlock, in the enjoyment of estates
in freehold and of unstained repute. Vassals or servants of any
lord, and tradespeople, were excluded. A third of the number
had annually to retire for a year, so that two-thirds formed
the sitting council. By the middle of the 13th century there
were two burgomasters (<i>magistri burgensium</i>). Meanwhile,
the number of magistrates (<i>consules</i>) had increased, ranging
from twenty to forty and upwards. The council appointed
its own officers in the various branches of the administration.
In the face of so much self-government the <i>Vogt</i> presently disappeared
altogether. There were three classes of inhabitants,
full freemen, half freemen and guests or foreigners. People of
Slav origin being considered unfree, all intermarriage with them
tainted the blood; hence nearly all surnames point to Saxon,
especially Westphalian, and even Flemish descent. The magistracy
was for two centuries almost exclusively in the hands
of the merchant aristocracy, who formed the companies of
traders or &ldquo;nations,&rdquo; such as the <i>Bergen-fahrer</i>, <i>Novgorod-fahrer</i>,
<i>Riga-fahrer</i> and <i>Stockholm-fahrer</i>. From the beginning,
however, tradesmen and handicraftsmen had settled in the
town, all of them freemen of German parentage and with property
and houses of their own. Though not eligible for the council,
they shared to a certain extent in the self-government through
the aldermen of each corporation or gild, of which some appear
as early as the statutes of 1240. Naturally, there arose much
jealousy between the gilds and the aristocratic companies,
which exclusively ruled the republic. After an attempt to upset
the merchants had been suppressed in 1384, the gilds succeeded,
under more favourable circumstances, in 1408. The old patrician
council left the city to appeal to the Hansa and to the imperial
authorities, while a new council with democratic tendencies, elected
chiefly from the gilds, took their place. In 1416, however, owing
to the pressure brought to bear by the Hansa, by the emperor
Sigismund and by Eric, king of Denmark, there was a restoration.
The aristocratic government was again expelled under the
dictatorship of Jürgen Wullenweber (<i>c.</i> 1492-1537), till the old
order was re-established in 1535. In the constitution of 1669,
under the pressure of a large public debt, the great companies
yielded a specified share in the financial administration to the
leading gilds of tradesmen. Nevertheless, the seven great companies
continued to choose the magistrates by co-optation among
themselves. Three of the four burgomasters and two of the
senators, however, had henceforth to be graduates in law. The
constitution, set aside only during the French occupation, has
subsequently been slowly reformed. From 1813 the popular
representatives had some share in the management of the
finances. But the reform committee of 1814, whose object was
to obtain an extension of the franchise, had made little progress,
when the events of 1848 led to the establishment of a representative
assembly of 120 members, elected by universal suffrage, which
obtained a place beside the senatorial government. The republic
has given up its own military contingent, its coinage and its
postal dues to the German Empire; but it has preserved its
municipal self-government and its own territory, the inhabitants
of which enjoy equal political privileges with the citizens.</p>

<p><i>The City of Lübeck.</i>&mdash;Lübeck, the capital of the free state, was
formerly the head of the Hanseatic League. It is situated on a
gentle ridge between the rivers Trave and Wakenitz, 10 m. S.W.
of the mouth of the former in the bay of Lübeck, 40 m. by rail
N.E. of Hamburg, at the junction of lines to Eutin, Büchen,
Travemünde and Strassburg (in Mecklenburg-Schwerin) and
consists of an inner town and three suburbs. The former
ramparts between the Trave and the old town ditch have been
converted into promenades. The city proper retains much of its
ancient grandeur, despite the tendency to modernize streets and
private houses. Foremost among its buildings must be mentioned
its five chief churches, stately Gothic edifices in glazed
brick, with lofty spires and replete with medieval works of art&mdash;pictures,
stained glass and tombs. Of them, the Marienkirche,
built in the 13th century, is one of the finest specimens of early
Gothic in Germany. The cathedral, or <i>Domkirche</i>, founded in
1173, contains some curious sarcophagi and a magnificent altarpiece
in one of the chapels, while the churches of St James
(<i>Jakobikirche</i>), of St Peter (<i>Petrikirche</i>) and of St Aegidius
(<i>Aegidienkirche</i>) are also remarkable. The <i>Rathaus</i> (town hall)
of red and black glazed brick, dating from various epochs during
the middle ages, is famous for its staircase, the vaulted wine
cellar of the city council beneath and magnificent wood carving.
There should also be mentioned the <i>Schiffershaus</i>; the medieval
gates (Holstentor, Burgtor); and the Hospital of the Holy
Ghost, remarkable for ancient frescoes and altars in rich wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
carving, the entrance hall of which is a 13th-century chapel,
restored in 1866 and decorated in 1898. The museum preserves
the most remarkable municipal archives in existence as well as
valuable collections of historical documents.</p>

<p>The poet, Emanuel Geibel (1889), and the painter, Johann
Friedrich Overbeck (1789-1869), were natives of Lübeck. This
city is famous for the number and wealth of its charitable
institutions. Its position as the first German emporium of the
west end of the Baltic has been to some extent impaired by
Hamburg and Bremen since the construction of the North Sea
and Baltic Canal, and by the rapid growth and enterprise of
Stettin. In order to counterbalance their rivalry, the quays have
been extended, a canal was opened in 1900 between the Trave
and the Elbe, the river up to the wharves has been deepened to
23 ft. or more. The river is kept open in winter by ice-breakers.
A harbour was made in 1899-1900 on the Wakenitz Canal for
boats engaged in inland traffic, especially on the Elbe and Elbe-Trave
Canal. Lübeck trades principally with Denmark, Sweden,
Finland, Russia, the eastern provinces of Prussia, Great Britain
and the United States. The imports amounted in value to about
£4,850,000 in 1906 and the exports to over £10,000,000. The
chief articles of import are coal, grain, timber, copper, steel and
wine, and the exports are manufactured goods principally to
Russia and Scandivania. The industries are growing, the chief
being breweries and distilleries, saw-mills and planing-mills,
shipbuilding, fish-curing, the manufacture of machinery, engines,
bricks, resin, preserves, enamelled and tin goods, cigars, furniture,
soap and leather. Pop. (1885) 55,399; (1905) 91,541.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Old Lübeck stood on the left bank of the Trave,
where it is joined by the river Schwartau, and was destroyed in
1138. Five years later Count Adolphus II. of Holstein founded
new Lübeck, a few miles farther up, on the peninsula Buku,
where the Trave is joined on the right by the Wakenitz, the
emissary of the lake of Ratzeburg. An excellent harbour,
sheltered against pirates, it became almost at once a competitor
for the commerce of the Baltic. Its foundation coincided with
the beginning of the advance of the Low German tribes of
Flanders, Friesland and Westphalia along the southern shores of
the Baltic&mdash;the second great emigration of the colonizing Saxon
element. In 1140 Wagria, in 1142 the country of the Polabes
(Ratzeburg and Lauenburg), had been annexed by the Holtsaetas
(the Transalbingian Saxons). From 1166 onwards there was a
Saxon count at Schwerin. Frisian and Saxon merchants from
Soest, Bardowiek and other localities in Lower Germany, who
already navigated the Baltic and had their factory in Gotland,
settled in the new town, where Wendish speech and customs
never entered. About 1157 Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony,
forced his vassal, the count of Holstein, to give up Lübeck to
him; and in 1163 he removed thither the episcopal see of
Oldenburg (Stargard), founding at the same time the dioceses
of Ratzeburg and Schwerin. He issued the first charter to the
citizens, and constituted them a free Saxon community having
their own magistrate, an advantage over all other towns of his
dominions. He invited traders of the north to visit his new
market free of toll and custom, providing his subjects were
promised similar privileges in return. From the beginning the
king of Denmark granted them a settlement for their herring
fishery on the coast of Schoonen. Adopting the statutes of
Soest in Westphalia as their code, Saxon merchants exclusively
ruled the city. In concurrence with the duke&rsquo;s <i>Vogt</i> (<i>advocatus</i>)
they recognized only one right of judicature within the town,
to which nobles as well as artisans had to submit. Under these
circumstances the population grew rapidly in wealth and influence
by land and sea, so that, when Henry was attainted by the
emperor, Frederick I., who came in person to besiege Lübeck
in 1181, this potentate, &ldquo;in consideration of its revenues and its
situation on the frontier of the Empire,&rdquo; fixed by charter, dated
the 19th of September 1188, the limits, and enlarged the liberties,
of the free town. In the year 1201 Lübeck was conquered by
Waldemar II. of Denmark. But in 1223 it regained its liberty,
after the king had been taken captive by the count of Schwerin.
In 1226 it was made a free city of the Empire by Frederick II.,
and its inhabitants took part with the enemies of the Danish
king in the victory of Bornhövede in July 1227. The citizens
repelled the encroachments of their neighbours in Holstein and
in Mecklenburg. On the other hand their town, being the
principal emporium of the Baltic by the middle of the 13th
century, acted as the firm ally of the Teutonic knights in Livonia.
Emigrants founded new cities and new sees of Low German
speech among alien and pagan races; and thus in the course
of a century the commerce of Lübeck had supplanted that of
Westphalia. In connexion with the Germans at Visby, the
capital of Gotland, and at Riga, where they had a house from
1231, the people of Lübeck with their armed vessels scoured the
sea between the Trave and the Neva. They were encouraged by
papal bulls in their contest for the rights of property in wrecks
and for the protection of shipping against pirates and slave-hunters.
Before the close of the century the statutes of Lübeck
were adopted by most Baltic towns having a German population,
and Visby protested in vain against the city on the Trave having
become the court of appeal for nearly all these cities, and even
for the German settlement in Russian Novgorod. In course of
time more than a hundred places were embraced in this relation,
the last vestiges of which did not disappear until the beginning
of the 18th century. From about 1299 Lübeck presided over a
league of cities, Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, Greifswald and
some smaller ones, and this Hansa of towns became heir to a
Hansa of traders simultaneously on the eastern and the western
sea, after Lübeck and her confederates had been admitted to the
same privileges with Cologne, Dortmund and Soest at Bruges
and in the steelyards of London, Lynn and Boston. The union
held its own, chiefly along the maritime outskirts of the Empire,
rather against the will of king and emperor, but nevertheless
Rudolph of Habsburg and several of his successors issued new
charters to Lübeck. As early as 1241 Lübeck, Hamburg and
Soest had combined to secure their highways against robber
knights. Treaties to enforce the public peace were concluded
in 1291 and 1338 with the dukes of Brunswick, Mecklenburg and
Pomerania, and the count of Holstein. Though the great federal
armament against Waldemar IV., the destroyer of Visby, was
decreed by the city representatives assembled at Cologne in
1367, Lübeck was the leading spirit in the war which ended with
the surrender of Copenhagen and the peace concluded at Stralsund
on the 24th of May 1370. Her burgomaster, Brun Warendorp,
who commanded the combined naval and land forces, died on
the field of battle. In 1368 the seal of the city, a double-headed
eagle, which in the 14th century took the place of the more ancient
ship, was adopted as the common seal of the confederated towns
(<i>civitates maritimae</i>), some seventy in number. Towards the end
of the 15th century the power of the Hanseatic League began
to decline, owing to the rise of Burgundy in the west, of Poland
and Russia in the east and the emancipation of the Scandinavian
kingdom from the union of Calmar. Still Lübeck, even when
nearly isolated, strove to preserve its predominance in a war
with Denmark (1501-12), supporting Gustavus Vasa in Sweden,
lording it over the north of Europe during the years 1534 and 1535
in the person of Jürgen Wullenweber, the democratic burgomaster,
who professed the most advanced principles of the
Reformation, and engaging with Sweden in a severe naval war
(1536-70).</p>

<p>But the prestige and prosperity of the town were beginning
to decline. Before the end of the 16th century the privileges
of the London Steelyard were suppressed by Elizabeth. As
early as 1425 the herring, a constant source of early wealth,
began to forsake the Baltic waters. Later on, by the discovery
of a new continent, commerce was diverted into new directions.
Finally, with the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, misfortunes came thick.
The last Hanseatic diet met at Lübeck in 1630, shortly after
Wallenstein&rsquo;s unsuccessful attack on Stralsund; and from that
time merciless sovereign powers stopped free intercourse on all
sides. Danes and Swedes battled for the possession of the Sound
and for its heavy dues. The often changing masters of Holstein
and Lauenburg abstracted much of the valuable landed property
of the city and of the chapter of Lübeck. Towards the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
the 18th century there were signs of improvement. Though
the Danes temporarily occupied the town in 1801, it preserved
its freedom and gained some of the chapter lands when the
imperial constitution of Germany was broken up by the act of
February 1803, while trade and commerce prospered for a few
years. But in November 1806, when Blücher, retiring from
the catastrophe of Jena, had to capitulate in the vicinity of
Lübeck, the town was sacked by the French. Napoleon annexed
it to his empire in December 1810. But it rose against the French
in March 1813, was re-occupied by them till the 5th of December,
and was ultimately declared a free and Hanse town of the German
Confederation by the act of Vienna of the 9th of June 1815.
The Hanseatic League, however, having never been officially
dissolved, Lübeck still enjoyed its traditional connexion with
Bremen and Hamburg. In 1853 they sold their common property,
the London Steelyard; until 1866 they enlisted by special
contract their military contingents for the German Confederation,
and down to 1879 they had their own court of appeal at Lübeck.
Lübeck joined the North German Confederation in 1866, profiting
by the retirement from Holstein and Lauenburg of the Danes,
whose interference had prevented as long as possible a direct
railway between Lübeck and Hamburg. On the 27th of June
1867 Lübeck concluded a military convention with Prussia,
and on the 11th of August 1868 entered the German Customs
Union (<i>Zollverein</i>), though reserving to itself certain privileges
in respect of its considerable wine trade and commerce with
the Baltic ports.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUBLIN,<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> a government of Russian Poland, bounded N. by
Siedlce, E. by Volhynia (the Bug forming the boundary), S.
by Galicia, and W. by Radom (the Vistula separating the two).
Area, 6499 sq. m. The surface is an undulating plain of Cretaceous
deposits, 800 to 900 ft. in altitude, and reaching in one place
1050 ft. It is largely covered with forests of oak, beech and
lime, intersected by ravines and thinly inhabited. A marshy
lowland extends between the Vistula and the Wieprz. The
government is drained by the Vistula and the Bug, and by their
tributaries the Wieprz, San and Tanev. Parts of the government,
being of black earth, are fertile, but other parts are sandy.
Agriculture is in good condition. Many Germans settled in
the government before immigration was stopped in 1887; in
1897 they numbered about 26,000. Rye, oats, wheat, barley
and potatoes are the chief crops, rye and wheat being exported.
Flax, hemp, buckwheat, peas, millet and beetroot are also
cultivated. Horses are carefully bred. In 1897 the population
was 1,165,122, of whom 604,886 were women. The Greek
Orthodox (chiefly Little Russians in the south-east) amounted
to 20.1% of the whole; Roman Catholics (<i>i.e.</i> Poles) to 62.8%;
Jews to 14.2%; and Protestants to 2.8%. The urban population
was 148,196 in 1897. The estimated population in 1906
was 1,362,500. Industrial establishments consist chiefly of
distilleries, sugar-works, steam flour-mills, tanneries, saw-mills
and factories of bent-wood furniture. Domestic industries are
widely developed in the villages. River navigation employs
a considerable portion of the population. The government
is divided into ten districts, the chief towns of which, with their
populations in 1897, are&mdash;Lublin, capital of the province (50,152);
Biegoray (6286); Cholm (19,236); Hrubieszow (10,699);
Yanów (7927); Krasnystaw or Kraznostav (8879); Lubartow
(5249); Nova-Alexandrya or Pulawy (3892); Samostye (12,400);

<p><span class="bold">LUBLIN,<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> a town of Russian Poland, capital of the government
of the same name, 109 m. by rail S.E. of Warsaw, on a small
tributary of the Wieprz. Pop. (1873) 28,900; (1897) 50,152.
It is the most important town of Poland after Warsaw and
Lodz, being one of the chief centres of the manufacture of thread-yarn,
linen and hempen goods and woollen stuffs; there is also
trade in grain and cattle. It has an old citadel, several palaces
of Polish nobles and many interesting churches, and is the headquarters
of the XIV. army corps, and the see of a Roman Catholic
bishop. The cathedral dates from the 16th century. Of the
former fortifications nothing remains except the four gates,
one dating from 1342.</p>

<p>Lublin was in existence in the 10th century, and has a church
which is said to have been built in 986. During the time the
Jagellon dynasty ruled over Lithuania and Poland it was the
most important city between the Vistula and the Dnieper, having
40,000 inhabitants (70,000 according to other authorities)
and all the trade with Podolia, Volhynia and Red Russia. Indeed,
the present town is surrounded with ruins, which prove that it
formerly covered a much larger area. But it was frequently
destroyed by the Tatars (<i>e.g.</i> 1240) and Cossacks (<i>e.g.</i> 1477).
In 1568-1569 it was the seat of the stormy convention at which
the union between Poland and Lithuania was decided. In
1702 another convention was held in Lublin, in favour of Augustus
II. and against Charles XII. of Sweden, who carried the town
by assault and plundered it. In 1831 Lublin was taken by the
Russians. The surrounding country is rich in reminiscences
of the struggle of Poland for independence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUBRICANTS.<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> Machines consist of parts which have
relative motion and generally slide and rub against each other.
Thus the axle of a cart or railway vehicle is pressed against a
metallic bearing surface supporting the body of the vehicle,
and the two opposed surfaces slide upon each other and are
pressed together with great force. If the metallic surfaces be
clean, the speed of rubbing high, and the force pressing the
surfaces together considerable, then the latter will abrade each
other, become hot and be rapidly destroyed. It is possible,
however, to prevent the serious abrasion of such opposing surfaces,
and largely to reduce the frictional resistance they oppose to
relative motion by the use of <i>lubricants</i> (Lat. <i>lubricare</i>, <i>lubricus</i>,
slippery). These substances are caused to insinuate themselves
between the surfaces, and have the property of so separating
them as to prevent serious abrasion. The solid and semi-solid
lubricants seem to act as rollers between the surfaces, or form a
film between them which itself suffers abrasion or friction. The
liquid lubricants, however, maintain themselves as liquid films
between the surfaces, upon which the bearing floats. The
frictional resistance is then wholly in the fluid. Even when
lubricants are used the friction, <i>i.e.</i> the resistance to motion
offered by the opposing surfaces, is considerable. In the article
Friction will be found a statement of how friction is measured
and the manner in which it is expressed. The coefficient of
friction is obtained by dividing the force required to cause the
surfaces to slide over each other by the load pressing them together.
For clean unlubricated surfaces this coefficient may be
as great as 0.3, whilst for well-lubricated cylindrical bearings
it may be as small as 0.0006. Engineers have, therefore, paid
particular attention to the design of bearings with the object
of reducing the friction, and thus making use of as much as
possible of the power developed by prime movers. The importance
of doing this will be seen when it is remembered that the
energy wasted is proportional to the coefficient of friction, and
that the durability of the parts depends upon the extent to which
they are separated by the lubricant and thus prevented from
injuring each other.</p>

<p>There is great diversity in the shapes of rubbing surfaces, the
loads they have to carry vary widely, and the speed of rubbing
ranges from less than one foot to thousands of feet per minute.
There is also a large number of substances which act as lubricants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
some being liquids and others soft solids. In many instruments or
machines where the surfaces in contact which have to slide upon
each other are only lightly pressed together, and are only occasionally
given relative motion, the lubricant is only needed to prevent
abrasion. Microscopes and mathematical instruments are of this
kind. In such cases, the lubricant which keeps the surfaces from
abrading each other is a mere contamination film, either derived
from the air or put on when the surfaces are finished. When such
lubricating films are depended upon, the friction surfaces should
be as hard as possible and, if practicable, of dissimilar metals.
In the absence of a contamination film, most metals, if rubbed
when in contact, will immediately adhere to each other. A large
number of experiments have been made to ascertain the coefficient
of friction under these imperfect conditions of lubrication.
Within wide limits of load, the friction is proportional to
the pressure normal to the surfaces and is, therefore, approximately
independent of the area of the surfaces in contact.
Although the static coefficient is often less than the kinetic at
very low speeds, within wide limits the latter coefficient decreases
with increasing speed. These laws apply to all bearings
the velocity of rubbing of which is very small, or which are
lubricated with solid or semi-solid materials.</p>

<p>When the speed of rubbing is considerable and the contamination
film is liable to be destroyed, resort is had to lubricants
which possess the power of keeping the surfaces apart, and
thereby reducing the friction. The constant application of such
substances is necessary in the case of such parts of machine
tools as slide rests, the surfaces of which only move relatively
to each other at moderate speeds, but which have to carry heavy
loads. In all ordinary cases, the coefficient of friction of flat
surfaces, such as those of slide blocks or pivot bearings, is high,
owing to the fact that the lubricant is not easily forced between
the surfaces. In the case of cylindrical bearing surfaces, such as
those of journals and spindles, owing to the fact that the radius
of the bearing surface is greater than that of the journal or spindle,
the lubricant, if a liquid, is easily drawn in and entirely separates
the surfaces (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lubrication</a></span>). Fortunately, cylindrical bearings
are by far the most common and important form of bearing,
and they can be so lubricated that the friction coefficient is very
low. The lubricant, owing to its viscosity, is forced between the
surfaces and keeps them entirely apart. This property of viscosity
is one of the most important possessed by liquid lubricants.
Some lubricants, such as the oils used for the light spindles of
textile machinery, are quite thin and limpid, whilst others,
suitable for steam engine cylinders and very heavy bearings, are,
at ordinary temperatures, as thick as treacle or honey. Generally
speaking, the greater the viscosity of the lubricant the
greater the load the bearing will carry, but with thick lubricants
the frictional coefficient is correspondingly high. True lubricants
differ from ordinary liquids of equal viscosity inasmuch as they
possess the property of &ldquo;oiliness.&rdquo; This is a property which
enables them to maintain an unbroken film between surfaces
when the loads are heavy. It is possessed most markedly by
vegetables and animal oils and fats, and less markedly by mineral
oils. In the case of mineral lubricating oils from the same
source, the lower the specific gravity the greater the oiliness of
the liquid, as a rule. Mixtures of mineral oil with animal or
vegetable oil are largely used, one class of oil supplying those
qualities in which the other is deficient. Thus the mineral
oils, which are comparatively cheap and possess the important
property of not becoming oxidized into gummy or sticky substances
by the action of the air, which also are not liable to
cause spontaneous ignition of cotton waste, &amp;c., and can be
manufactured of almost any desired viscosity, but which on the
other hand are somewhat deficient in the property of oiliness,
are mixed with animal or vegetable oils which possess the latter
property in marked degree, but are liable to gum and become
acid and to cause spontaneous ignition, besides being comparatively
expensive and limited in quantity. Oils which become
acid attack the bearings chemically, and those which oxidize
may become so thick that they fail to run on to the bearings
properly.</p>

<p><i>Solid Lubricants.</i>&mdash;Solid substances, such as graphite or plumbago,
soapstone, &amp;c., are used as lubricants when there is some objection
to liquids or soft solids, but the surfaces between which they are
placed should be of very hard materials. They are frequently mixed
with oils or greases, the lubricating properties of which they improve.</p>

<p><i>Semi-solid Lubricants.</i>&mdash;The contrast in lubricating properties
between mineral and fatty oils exists also in the case of a pure mineral
grease like vaseline and an animal fat such as tallow, the latter
possessing in a far greater degree the property of greasiness. A
large number of lubricating greases are made by incorporating or
emulsifying animal and vegetable fats with soap and water; also by
thickening mineral lubricating oils with soap. Large quantities of
these greases are used with very good results for the lubrication of
railway waggon axles, and some of them are excellent lubricants for
the bearings of slow moving machinery. Care must be taken, however,
that they do not contain excess of water and are not adulterated
with such useless substances as china clay; also, that they melt as a
whole, and that the oil does not run down and leave the soap. This
is liable to occur with badly made greases, and hot bearings are the
result. Except in special cases, greases should not be used for
quick-running journals, shafts or spindles, on account of the high
frictional resistance which they offer to motion. In the case of fats
and greases whose melting points are not much above the temperature
of surrounding objects it generally happens that the lubricating
films are so warmed by friction that they actually melt and act as
oils. These lubricants are generally forced into the bearings by a form
of syringe fitted with a spring piston, or are squeezed between the
faces by means of a screw-plug.</p>

<p><i>Liquid Lubricants.</i>&mdash;Generally speaking, all bearings which it is
necessary should run with as little friction as possible must be supplied
with liquid lubricants. These may be of animal, vegetable or
mineral origin. The mineral oils are mixtures of hydrocarbons of
variable viscosity, flashing-point, density and oiliness. They are
obtained by distillation from American, Russian and other
petroleums. The fixed oils obtained from animal and vegetable
substances are not volatile without decomposition, and are found
ready made in the tissues of animals and plants. Animal oils are
obtained from the adipose tissue by simple heat or by boiling with
water. They are usually either colourless or yellow. The oils of
plants occur usually in the seeds or fruit, and are obtained either
by expression or by means of solvents such as ether or petroleum.
They are of various shades of yellow and green, the green colour
being due to the presence of chlorophyll. The fundamental difference
between fixed oils and mineral oils exists in their behaviour towards
oxygen. Mineral oils at ordinary temperatures are indifferent to
oxygen, but all fixed oils combine with it and thicken or gum more
or less, generating heat at the same time. Such oils are, therefore,
dangerous if dropped upon silk, cotton or woollen waste or other
combustible fibrous materials, which are thus rendered liable to
spontaneous ignition.</p>

<p>Liquid lubricants are used for all high speed bearings. In some
cases the rubbing surfaces work in a bath of the lubricant, which
can then reach all the rubbing parts with certainty. Small engines
for motor cars or road waggons are often lubricated in this way. In
the case of individual bearings, such as those of railway vehicles, a
pad of cotton, worsted and horse hair is kept saturated with the
lubricant and pressed against the under side of the journal. The
journal is thus kept constantly wetted with oil, and the film is forced
beneath the brass as the axle rotates. In many cases, oil-ways and
grooves are cut in the bearings, and the lubricant is allowed to run
by gravity into them and thus finds its way between the opposing
surfaces. To secure a steady feed various contrivances are adopted,
the most common being a wick of cotton or worsted used as a siphon.
In cases where it is important that little if any wear should take
place, the lubricant is forced by means of a pump between the friction
surfaces and a constant film of oil is thereby maintained between
them.</p>

<p>For the spindles of small machines such as clocks, watches and
other delicate mechanisms, which are only lubricated at long intervals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
and are often exposed to extremes of temperature, the lubricant
must be a fluid oil as free as possible from tendency to gum or thicken
by oxidation or to corrode metal, and must often have a low
freezing-point.
It must also possess a maximum of &ldquo;oiliness.&rdquo; The
lubricants mostly used for such purposes are obtained from porpoise
or dolphin jaw oils, bean oil, hazel nut oil, neatsfoot oil, sperm oil
or olive oil. These oils are exposed for some time to temperatures as
low as the mechanism is required to work at, and the portion which
remains fluid is separated and used. Free acid should be entirely
eliminated by chemical refining. A little good mineral oil may with
advantage be mixed with the fatty oil.</p>

<p>For all ordinary machinery, ranging from the light ring spindles of
textile mills to the heavy shafts of large engines, mineral oils are
almost universally employed, either alone or mixed with fatty oils,
the general rule being to use pure mineral oils for bath, forced or
circulating pump lubrication, and mixed oils for drop, siphon and
other less perfect methods of lubrication. Pure mineral oils of
relatively low viscosity are used for high speeds and low pressures,
mixed oils of greater viscosity for low speeds and high pressures.
In selecting oils for low speeds and great pressures, viscosity must be
the first consideration, and next to that &ldquo;oiliness.&rdquo; If an oil of
sufficiently high viscosity be used, a mineral oil may give a result as
good or better than a pure fixed oil; a mixed oil may give a better
result than either. If a mineral oil of sufficient viscosity be not
available, then a fixed oil or fat may be expected to give the best
result.</p>

<p>In special cases, such as in the lubrication of textile machines,
where the oil is liable to be splashed upon the fabric, the primary
consideration is to use an oil which can be washed out without
leaving a stain. Pure fixed oils, or mixtures composed largely of
fixed oils, are used for such purposes.</p>

<p>In other special cases, such as marine engines working in hot places,
mixtures are used of mineral oil with rape or other vegetable oil
artificially thickened by blowing air through the heated oil, and
known as &ldquo;blown&rdquo; oil or &ldquo;soluble castor oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the lubrication of the cylinders and valves of steam, gas and oil
engines, the lubricant must possess as much viscosity as possible at
the working temperature, must not evaporate appreciably and must
not decompose and liberate fatty acids which would corrode the metal
and choke the steam passages with metallic soaps; for gas and oil
engines the lubricant must be as free as possible from tendency to
decompose and deposit carbon when heated. For this reason steam
cylinders and valves should be lubricated with pure mineral oils of
the highest viscosity, mixed with no more fixed oil than is necessary
to ensure efficient lubrication. Gas and oil engines also should be
lubricated with pure mineral oils wherever possible.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUBRICATION.<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> Our knowledge of the action of oils and other
viscous fluids in diminishing friction and wear between solid
surfaces from being purely empirical has become a connected
theory, based on the known properties of matter, subjected to the
definition of mathematical analysis and verified by experiment.
The theory was published in 1886 (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1886, 177, pp.
157-234); but it is the purpose of this article not so much to
explain its application, as to give a brief account of the introduction
of the misconceptions that so long prevailed, and of the
manner in which their removal led to its general acceptance.</p>

<p>Friction, or resistance to tangential shifting of matter over
matter, whatever the mode and arrangement, differs greatly
according to the materials, but, like all material resistance, is
essentially limited. The range of the limits in available materials
has a primary place in determining mechanical possibilities,
and from the earliest times they have demanded the closest
attention on the part of all who have to do with structures or
with machines, the former being concerned to find those materials
and their arrangements which possess the highest limits, and the
latter the materials in which the limits are least. Long before the
reformation of science in the 15th and 16th centuries both these
limits had formed the subject of such empirical research as
disclosed numerous definite although disconnected circumstances
under which they could be secured; and these, however far from
the highest and lowest, satisfied the exigencies of practical
mechanics at the time, thus initiating the method of extending
knowledge which was to be subsequently recognized as the only
basis of physical philosophy. In this purely empirical research
the conclusion arrived at represented the results for the actual
circumstance from which they were drawn, and thus afforded no
place for theoretical discrepancies. However, in the attempts at
generalization which followed the reformation of science, opportunity
was afforded for such discrepancies in the mere enunciation
of the circumstances in which the so-called laws of friction of
motion are supposed to apply. The circumstances in which
the great amount of empirical research was conducted as to the
resistance between the clean, plane, smooth surfaces of rigid
bodies moving over each other under pressure, invariably include
the presence of air at atmospheric pressure around, and to some
extent between, the surfaces; but this fact had received no
notice in the enunciation of these laws, and this constitutes
a theoretical departure from the conditions under which the
experience had been obtained. Also, the theoretical division
of the law of frictional resistance into two laws&mdash;one dealing with
the limit of rest, and the other asserting that the friction of
motion, which is invariably less in similar circumstances than
that of rest, is independent of the velocity of sliding&mdash;involves
the theoretical assumption that there is no asymptotic law of
diminution of the resistance, since, starting from rest, the
rate of sliding increases. The theoretical substitution of ideal
rigid bodies with geometrically regular surfaces, sliding in contact
under pressure at the common regular surface, for the aërated
surfaces in the actual circumstances, and the theoretical substitution
of the absolute independence of the resistance of the
rate of sliding for the limited independence in the actual circumstances,
prove the general acceptance of the conceptions&mdash;(1)
that matter can slide over matter under pressure at a geometrically
regular surface; (2) that, however much the resistance
to sliding under any particular pressure (the coefficient of
friction) may depend on the physical properties of the materials,
the sliding under pressure takes place at the geometrically
regular surface of contact of the rigid bodies; and (3) as the
consequence of (1) and (2), that whatever the effect of a lubricant,
such as oil, might have, it could be a physical surface effect. Thus
not only did these general theoretical conceptions, resulting
from the theoretical laws of friction, fail to indicate that the
lubricant may diminish the resistance by the mere mechanical
separation of the surfaces, but they precluded the idea that such
might be the case. The result was that all subsequent attempts
to reduce the empirical facts, where a lubricant was used, to
such general laws as might reveal the separate functions of the
complex circumstances on which lubrication depends, completely
failed. Thus until 1883 the science of lubrication had
not advanced beyond the empirical stage.</p>

<p>This period of stagnation was terminated by an accidental
phenomenon observed by Beauchamp Tower, while engaged
on his research on the friction of the journals of railway carriages.
His observation led him to a line of experiments which proved
that in these experiments the general function of the lubricant
was the mechanical separation of the metal surfaces by a layer
of fluid of finite thickness, thus upsetting the preconceived ideas
as expressed in the laws of the friction of motion. On the publication
of Tower&rsquo;s reports (<i>Proc. Inst. M.E.</i>, November 1883), it
was recognized by several physicists (<i>B.A. Report</i>, 1884, pp. 14,
625) that the evidence they contained afforded a basis for
further study of the actions involved, indicating as it did the
circumstances&mdash;namely, the properties of viscosity and cohesion
possessed by fluids&mdash;account of which had not been taken in
previous conclusions. It also became apparent that continuous
or steady lubrication, such as that of Tower&rsquo;s experiments, is
only secured when the solid surfaces separated by the lubricant
are so shaped that the thickness at the ingoing side is greater than
that at the outgoing side.</p>

are linear functions of the distortional rates of strain multiplied
by a constant coefficient, it was found that the only solutions
of which the equations admitted, when applied to fluids flowing
between fixed boundaries, as water in a pipe, were singular
solutions for steady or steady periodic motion, and that the
conclusions they entailed, that the resistance would be proportional
to the velocity, were for the most part directly at
variance with the common experience that the resistances
varied with the square of the velocity. This discrepancy was
sometimes supposed to be the result of eddies in the fluid, but
it was not till 1883 that it was discovered by experiments with
colour bands that, in the case of geometrically similar boundaries,
the existence or non-existence of such eddies depended upon
a definite relation between the mean velocity (U) of the fluid,
the distance between the boundaries, and the ratio of the coefficient
of viscosity to the density (&mu;/&rho;), expressed by UD&rho;/&mu; = K,
where K is a physical constant independent of units, which has
a value between 1900 and 2000, and for parallel boundaries
D is four times the area of the channel divided by the perimeter
of the section (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1883, part iii. 935-982). K is thus
a criterion at which the law of resistance to the mean flow changes
suddenly (as U increases), from being proportional to the flow,
to a law involving higher powers of the velocity at first, but as
the rates increase approaching an asymptote in which the power
is a little less that the square.</p>

<p>This sudden change in the law of resistance to the flow of
fluid between solid boundaries, depending as it does on a complete
change in the manner of the flow&mdash;from direct parallel flow to
sinuous eddying motion&mdash;serves to determine analytically the
circumstances as to the velocity and the thickness of the film
under which any fluid having a particular coefficient of viscosity
can act the part of a lubricant. For as long as the circumstances
are such that UD&rho;/&mu; is less than K, the parallel flow is held stable
by the viscosity, so that only one solution is possible&mdash;that
in which the resistance is the product of &mu; multiplied by the
rate of distortion, as &mu;(du/dy); in this case the fluid has lubricating
properties. But when the circumstances are such that UD&rho;/&mu;
is greater than K, other solutions become possible, and the
parallel flow becomes unstable, breaks down into eddying
motion, and the resistance varies as &rho;u<span class="sp">n</span>, which approximates
to &rho;u<span class="sp">1.78</span> as the velocity increases; in this state the fluid has
no lubricating properties. Thus, within the limits of the criterion,
the rate of displacement of the momentum of the fluid is insignificant
as compared with the viscous resistance, and may
be neglected; while outside this limit the direct effects of the
eddying motion completely dominate the viscous resistance,
which in its turn may be neglected. Thus K is a criterion which
separates the flow of fluid between solid surfaces as definitely
as the flow of fluid is separated from the relative motions in
elastic solids, and it is by the knowledge of the limit on which
this distinction depends that the theory of viscous flow can
with assurance be applied to the circumstance of lubrication.</p>

<p>Until the existence of this physical constant was discovered,
any theoretical conclusions as to whether in any particular
circumstances the resistance of the lubricant would follow the
law of viscous flow or that of eddying motion was impossible.
Thus Tower, being unaware of the discovery of the criterion,
which was published in the same year as his reports, was thrown
off the scent in his endeavour to verify the evidence he had
obtained as to the finite thickness of the film by varying the
velocity. He remarks in his first report that, &ldquo;according
to the theory of fluid motion, the resistance would be as the
square of the velocity, whereas in his results it did not increase
according to this law.&rdquo; The rational theory of lubrication does
not, however, depend solely on the viscosity within the interior
of fluids, but also depends on the surface action between the
fluid and the solid. In many respects the surface actions, as
indicated by surface tension, are still obscure, and there has
been a general tendency to assume that there may be discontinuity
in the velocity at the common surface. But whatever these
actions may be in other respects, there is abundant evidence
that there is no appreciable discontinuity in the velocity at the
surfaces as long as the fluid has finite thickness. Hence in the
case of lubrication the velocities of the fluid at the surfaces of
the solids are those of the solid. In as far as the presence of
the lubricant is necessary, such properties as cause oil in spite
of its surface tension to spread even against gravity over a bright
metal surface, while mercury will concentrate into globules on
the bright surface of iron, have an important place in securing
lubrication where the action is intermittent, as in the escapement
of a clock. If there is oil on the pallet, although the pressure
of the tooth causes this to flow out laterally from between the
surfaces, it goes back again by surface tension during the
intervals; hence the importance of using fluids with low surface
tension like oil, or special oils, when there is no other means of
securing the presence of the lubricant.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The differential equations for the equilibrium of the lubricant are
what the differential equations of viscous fluid in steady motion
become when subject to the conditions necessary for lubrication
as already defined&mdash;(1) the velocity is below the critical value;
(2) at the surfaces the velocity of the fluid is that of the solid;
(3) the thickness of the film is small compared with the lateral
dimensions of the surfaces and the radii of curvature of the surfaces.
By the first of these conditions all the terms having &rho; as a factor
may be neglected, and the equations thus become the equations of
equilibrium of the fluid; as such, they are applicable to fluid whether
incompressible or elastic, and however the pressure may affect the
viscosity. But the analysis is greatly simplified by omitting all
terms depending on compressibility and by taking &mu; constant; this
may be done without loss of generality in a qualitative sense. With
these limitations we have for the differential equation of the equilibrium
of the lubricant:&mdash;</p>

<p>Equations (5) and (6) are the general equations for the stresses
at the boundaries at x, z, when h is a continuous function of x and z,
&mu; and &rho; being constant.</p>

<p>For the integration of equations (6) to get the resultant stresses
and moments on the solid boundaries, so as to obtain the conditions
of their equilibrium, it is necessary to know how x and z at any point
on the boundary enter into h, as well as the equation &fnof;(x, z) = 0,
which determines the limits of the lubricating film. If y, the normal
to one of the surfaces, has not the same direction for all points of
this surface, in other words, if the surface is not plane, x and z become
curvilinear co-ordinates, at all points perpendicular to y. Since,
for lubrication, one of the surfaces must be plane, cylindrical, or a
surface of revolution, we may put x = R&theta;, y = r &minus; R, and z perpendicular
to the plane of motion. Then, if the data are sufficient, the resultant
stresses and moments between the surfaces are obtained by integrating
the intensity of the stress and moments of intensity of stress over
the surface.</p>

<p>This, however, is not the usual problem that arises. What is
generally wanted is to find the thickness of the film where least
(h<span class="su">0</span>) and its angular position with respect to direction of load, to resist a
definite load with a particular surface velocity. If the surfaces are
plane, the general solution involves only one arbitrary constant, the
least thickness (h<span class="su">0</span>); since in any particular case the variation of h
with x is necessarily fixed, as in this case lubrication affords no automatic
adjustment of this slope. When both surfaces are curved in
the plane of motion there are at least two arbitrary constants, h<span class="su">0</span>,
and &phi; the angular position of h<span class="su">0</span> with respect to direction of load;
while if the surfaces are both curved in a plane perpendicular to the
direction of motion as well as in the plane of motion, there are three
arbitrary constants, h<span class="su">0</span>, &phi;<span class="su">0</span>, z<span class="su">0</span>. The only constraint necessary is to
prevent rotation in the plane of motion of one of the surfaces, leaving
this surface free to move in any direction and to adjust its position so
as to be in equilibrium under the load.</p>
</div>

<p>The integrations necessary for the solutions of these problems
are practicable&mdash;complete or approximate&mdash;and have been
effected for circumstances which include the chief cases of
practical lubrication, the results having been verified by reference
to Tower&rsquo;s experiments. In this way the verified theory is
available for guidance outside the limits of experience as well
as for determining the limiting conditions. But it is necessary
to take into account certain subsidiary theories. These limits
depend on the coefficient of viscosity, which diminishes as the
temperature increases. The total work in overcoming the resistance
is spent in generating heat in the lubricant, the volume
of which is very small. Were it not for the escape of heat by
conduction through the lubricant and the metal, lubrication
would be impossible. Hence a knowledge of the empirical law
of the variation of the viscosity of the lubricant with temperature,
the coefficients of conduction of heat in the lubricant and in
the metal, and the application of the theory of the flow of heat
in the particular circumstances, are necessary adjuncts to the
theory of lubrication for determining the limits of lubrication.
Nor is this all, for the shapes of the solid surfaces vary with the
pressure, and more particularly with the temperature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCAN<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Marcus Annaeus Lucanus</span>], (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 39-65), Roman
poet of the Silver Age, grandson of the rhetorician Seneca and
nephew of the philosopher, was born at Corduba. His mother
was Acilia; his father, Marcus Annaeus Mela, had amassed
great wealth as imperial procurator for the provinces. From
a memoir which is generally attributed to Suetonius we learn
that Lucan was taken to Rome at the age of eight months and
displayed remarkable precocity. One of his instructors was the
Stoic philosopher, Cornutus, the friend and teacher of Persius.
He was studying at Athens when Nero recalled him to Rome
and made him quaestor. These friendly relations did not last
long. Lucan is said to have defeated Nero in a public
poetical contest; Nero forbade him to recite in public, and the
poet&rsquo;s indignation made him an accomplice in the conspiracy
of Piso. Upon the discovery of the plot he is said to have been
tempted by the hope of pardon to denounce his own mother.
Failing to obtain a reprieve, he caused his veins to be opened,
and expired repeating a passage from one of his poems descriptive
of the death of a wounded soldier. His father was involved
in the proscription, his mother escaped, and his widow Polla
Argentaria survived to receive the homage of Statius under
Domitian. The birthday of Lucan was kept as a festival after
his death, and a poem addressed to his widow upon one of these
occasions and containing information on the poet&rsquo;s work and
career is still extant (Statius&rsquo;s <i>Silvae</i>, ii. 7, entitled <i>Genethliacon
Lucani</i>).</p>

<p>Besides his principal performance, Lucan&rsquo;s works included
poems on the ransom of Hector, the nether world, the fate of
Orpheus, a eulogy of Nero, the burning of Rome, and one in
honour of his wife (all mentioned by Statius), letters, epigrams,
an unfinished tragedy on the subject of Medea and numerous
miscellaneous pieces. His minor works have perished except
for a few fragments, but all that the author wrote of the <i>Pharsalia</i>
has come down to us. It would probably have concluded with
the battle of Philippi, but breaks off abruptly as Caesar is about
to plunge into the harbour of Alexandria. The <i>Pharsalia</i> opens
with a panegyric of Nero, sketches the causes of the war and the
characters of Caesar and Pompey, the crossing of the Rubicon
by Caesar, the flight of the tribunes to his camp, and the panic
and confusion in Rome, which Pompey has abandoned. The
second book describes the visit of Brutus to Cato, who is persuaded
to join the side of the senate, and his marriage a second time to
his former wife Marcia, Ahenobarbus&rsquo;s capitulation at Corfinium
and the retirement of Pompey to Greece. In the third book
Caesar, after settling affairs in Rome, crosses the Alps for Spain.
Massilia is besieged and falls. The fourth book describes the
victories of Caesar in Spain over Afranius and Petreius, and the
defeat of Curio by Juba in Africa. In the fifth Caesar and Antony
land in Greece, and Pompey&rsquo;s wife Cornelia is placed in security
at Lesbos. The sixth book describes the repulses of Caesar
round Dyrrhachium, the seventh the defeat of Pompey at
Pharsalia, the eighth his flight and assassination in Egypt,
the ninth the operations of Cato in Africa and his march through
the desert, and the landing of Caesar in Egypt, the tenth the
opening incidents of the Alexandrian war. The incompleteness
of the work should not be left out of account in the estimate of
its merits, for, with two capital exceptions, the faults of the
<i>Pharsalia</i> are such as revision might have mitigated or rendered.
No such pains, certainly, could have amended the deficiency
of unity of action, or supplied the want of a legitimate protagonist.
The <i>Pharsalia</i> is not true to history, but it cannot shake off its
shackles, and is rather a metrical chronicle than a true epic.
If it had been completed according to the author&rsquo;s design,
Pompey, Cato and Brutus must have successively enacted the
part of nominal hero, while the real hero is the arch-enemy
of liberty and Lucan, Caesar. Yet these defects, though glaring,
are not fatal or peculiar to Lucan. The false taste, the strained
rhetoric, the ostentatious erudition, the tedious harangues and
far-fetched or commonplace reflections so frequent in this
singularly unequal poem, are faults much more irritating, but
they are also faults capable of amendment, which the writer
might not improbably have removed. Great allowance should
also be made in the case of one who is emulating predecessors
who have already carried art to its last perfection. Lucan&rsquo;s
temper could never have brooked mere imitation; his versification,
no less than his subject, is entirely his own; he avoids
the appearance of outward resemblance to his great predecessor
with a persistency which can only have resulted from deliberate
purpose, but he is largely influenced by the declamatory school
of his grandfather and uncle. Hence his partiality for finished
antithesis, contrasting strongly with his generally breathless
style and turbid diction. Quintilian sums up both aspects of
his genius with pregnant brevity, &ldquo;Ardens et concitatus et
sententiis clarissimus,&rdquo; adding with equal justice, &ldquo;Magis
oratoribus quam poetis annumerandus.&rdquo; Lucan&rsquo;s oratory,
however, frequently approaches the regions of poetry, <i>e.g.</i> the
apotheosis of Pompey at the beginning of the ninth book, and
the passage in the same book where Cato, in the truest spirit of
the Stoic philosophy, refuses to consult the oracle of Jupiter
Ammon. Though in many cases Lucan&rsquo;s rhetoric is frigid,
hyperbolical, and out of keeping with the character of the speaker,
yet his theme has a genuine hold upon him; in the age of Nero
he celebrates the republic as a poet with the same energy with
which in the age of Cicero he might have defended it as an orator.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
But for him it might almost have been said that the Roman
republic never inspired the Roman muse.</p>

<p>Lucan never speaks of himself, but his epic speaks for him.
He must have been endowed with no common ambition, industry
and self-reliance, an enthusiastic though narrow and aristocratic
patriotism, and a faculty for appreciating magnanimity in others.
But the only personal trait positively known to us is his conjugal
affection, a characteristic of Seneca also.</p>

<p>Lucan, together with Statius, was preferred even to Virgil
in the middle ages. So late as 1493 his commentator Sulpitius
writes: &ldquo;Magnus profecto est Maro, magnus Lucanus;
adeoque prope par, ut quis sit major possis ambigere.&rdquo; Shelley
and Southey, in the first transport of admiration, thought
Lucan superior to Virgil; Pope, with more judgment, says that
the fire which burns in Virgil with an equable glow breaks forth
in Lucan with sudden, brief and interrupted flashes. Of late,
notwithstanding the enthusiasm of isolated admirers, Lucan
has been unduly neglected, but he has exercised an important
influence upon one great department of modern literature by his
effect upon Corneille, and through him upon the classical French
drama.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities.</span>&mdash;The <i>Pharsalia</i> was much read in the middle ages,
and consequently it is preserved in a large number of manuscripts,
the relations of which have not yet been thoroughly made out.
The most recent critical text is that of C. Hosius (2nd ed. 1906),
and the latest complete commentaries are those of C. E. Haskins
(1887, with a valuable introduction by W. E. Heitland) and C. M.

<p><span class="bold">LUCANIA,<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> in ancient geography, a district of southern Italy,
extending from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Gulf of Tarentum.
To the north it adjoined Campania, Samnium and Apulia, and
to the south it was separated by a narrow isthmus from the
district of Bruttii. It thus comprised almost all the modern
province of the Basilicata, with the greater part of the province
of Salerno and a portion of that of Cosenza. The
precise limits were the river Silarus on the north-west, which
separated it from Campania, and the Bradanus, which flows
into the Gulf of Tarentum, on the north-east; while the two
little rivers Laus and Crathis, flowing from the ridge of the
Apennines to the sea on the west and east, marked the limits
of the district on the side of the Bruttii.</p>

<p>Almost the whole is occupied by the Apennines, here an
irregular group of lofty masses. The main ridge approaches
the western sea, and is continued from the lofty knot of mountains
on the frontiers of Samnium, nearly due south to within a few
miles of the Gulf of Policastro, and thenceforward is separated
from the sea by only a narrow interval till it enters the district
of the Bruttii. Just within the frontier of Lucania rises Monte
Pollino, 7325 ft., the highest peak in the southern Apennines.
The mountains descend by a much more gradual slope to the
coastal plain of the Gulf of Tarentum. Thus the rivers which
flow to the Tyrrhenian Sea are of little importance compared
with those that descend towards the Gulf of Tarentum. Of
these the most important are&mdash;the Bradanus (Bradano), the
Casuentus (Basiento), the Aciris (Agri), and the Siris (Sinno).
The Crathis, which forms at its mouth the southern limit of the
province, belongs almost wholly to the territory of the Bruttii,
but it receives a tributary, the Sybaris (Coscile), from the
mountains of Lucania. The only considerable stream on the
western side is the Silarus (Sele), which constitutes the northern
boundary, and has two important tributaries in the Calor
(Calore) and the Tanager (Negro) which joins it from the south.</p>

<p>The district of Lucania was so called from the people bearing
the name Lucani (Lucanians) by whom it was conquered about
the middle of the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Before that period it was
included under the general name of Oenotria, which was applied
by the Greeks to the southernmost portion of Italy. The
mountainous interior was occupied by the tribes known as
Oenotrians and Chones, while the coasts on both sides were
occupied by powerful Greek colonies which doubtless exercised
a protectorate over the interior (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Magna Graecia</a></span>). The
Lucanians were a southern branch of the Samnite or Sabelline
race, who spoke the Osca Lingua (<i>q.v.</i>). We know from Strabo
that they had a democratic constitution save in time of war,
when a dictator was chosen from among the regular magistrates.
A few Oscan inscriptions survive, mostly in Greek characters,
from the 4th or 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and some coins with Oscan
legends of the 3rd century (see Conway, Italic Dialects, p. 11 sqq.;
Mommsen, <i>C.I.L.</i> x. p. 21; Roehl, <i>Inscriptiones Graecae Antiquissimae</i>,
547). The Lucanians gradually conquered the whole
country (with the exception of the Greek towns on the coast)
from the borders of Samnium and Campania to the southern
extremity of Italy. Subsequently the inhabitants of the
peninsula, now known as Calabria, broke into insurrection, and
under the name of Bruttians established their independence,
after which the Lucanians became confined within the limits
already described. After this we find them engaged in hostilities
with the Tarentines, and with Alexander, king of Epirus, who
was called in by that people to their assistance, 326 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> In 298
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Livy x. 11 seq.) they made alliance with Rome, and Roman
influence was extended by the colonies of Venusia (291 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
Paestum (273), and above all Tarentum (272). Subsequently
they were sometimes in alliance, but more frequently engaged
in hostilities, during the Samnite wars. On the landing of
Pyrrhus in Italy (281 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) they were among the first to declare
in his favour, and found themselves exposed to the resentment
of Rome when the departure of Pyrrhus left his allies at the
mercy of the Romans. After several campaigns they were reduced
to subjection (272 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Notwithstanding this they espoused
the cause of Hannibal during the Second Punic War (216 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
and their territory during several campaigns was ravaged by
both armies. The country never recovered from these disasters,
and under the Roman government fell into decay, to which
the Social War, in which the Lucanians took part with the
Samnites against Rome (90-88 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) gave the finishing stroke.
In the time of Strabo the Greek cities on the coast had fallen
into insignificance, and owing to the decrease of population and
cultivation the malaria began to obtain the upper hand. The
few towns of the interior were of no importance. A large part
of the province was given up to pasture, and the mountains
were covered with forests, which abounded in wild boars, bears
and wolves. There were some fifteen independent communities,
but none of great importance.</p>

<p>For administrative purposes under the Roman empire,
Lucania was always united with the district of the Bruttii.
The two together constituted the third region of Augustus.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The towns on the east coast were&mdash;Metapontum, a few miles south
of the Bradanus; Heraclea, at the mouth of the Aciris; and Siris,
on the river of the same name. Close to its southern frontier stood
Sybaris, which was destroyed in 510 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but subsequently replaced
by Thurii. On the west coast stood Posidonia, known under the
Roman government as Paestum; below that came Elea or Velia,
Pyxus, called by the Romans Buxentum, and Laus, near the frontier
of the province towards Bruttium. Of the towns of the interior
the most considerable was Potentia, still called Potenza. To the
north, near the frontier of Apulia, was Bantia (Aceruntia belonged
more properly to Apulia); while due south from Potentia was
Grumentum, and still farther in that direction were Nerulum and
Muranum. In the upland valley of the Tanagrus were Atina,
Forum Popilii and Consilinum; Eburi (Eboli) and Volceii (Buccino),
though to the north of the Silarus, were also included in Lucania.
The Via Popillia traversed the district from N. to S., entering it at
the N.W. extremity; the Via Herculia, coming southwards from
the Via Appia and passing through Potentia and Grumentum, joined
the Via Popillia near the S.W. edge of the district: while another
nameless road followed the east coast and other roads of less importance
ran W. from Potentia to the Via Popillia, N.E. to the Via Appia
and E. from Grumentum to the coast at Heraclea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCARIS, CYRILLUS<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> (1572-1637), Greek prelate and theologian,
was a native of Crete. In youth he travelled, studying
at Venice and Padua, and at Geneva coming under the influence
of the reformed faith as represented by Calvin. In 1602 he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
elected patriarch of Alexandria, and in 1621 patriarch of Constantinople.
He was the first great name in the Orthodox
Eastern Church since 1453, and dominates its history in the
17th century. The great aim of his life was to reform the church
on Calvinistic lines, and to this end he sent many young Greek
theologians to the universities of Switzerland, Holland and
England. In 1629 he published his famous <i>Confessio</i>, Calvinistic
in doctrine, but as far as possible accommodated to the language
and creeds of the Orthodox Church. It appeared the same year
in two Latin editions, four French, one German and one English,
and in the Eastern Church started a controversy which culminated
in 1691 in the convocation by Dositheos, patriarch of Jerusalem,
of a synod by which the Calvinistic doctrines were condemned.
Lucaris was several times temporarily deposed and banished
at the instigation of his orthodox opponents and of the Jesuits,
who were his bitterest enemies. Finally, when Sultan Murad
was about to set out for the Persian War, the patriarch was
accused of a design to stir up the Cossacks, and to avoid trouble
during his absence the sultan had him killed by the Janissaries
(June 1637). His body was thrown into the sea, recovered and
buried at a distance from the capital by his friends, and only
brought back to Constantinople after many years.</p>

<p>The orthodoxy of Lucaris himself continued to be a matter
of debate in the Eastern Church, even Dositheos, in view of the
reputation of the great patriarch, thinking it expedient to gloss
over his heterodoxy in the interests of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCAS, SIR CHARLES<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> (d. 1648), English soldier, was the son
of Sir Thomas Lucas of Colchester, Essex. As a young man
he saw service in the Netherlands under the command of his
brother, and in the &ldquo;Bishops&rsquo; War&rdquo; he commanded a troop
of horse in King Charles I.&rsquo;s army. In 1639 he was made a knight.
At the outbreak of the Civil War Lucas naturally took the king&rsquo;s
side, and at the first cavalry fight, Powick Bridge, he was wounded.
Early in 1643 he raised a regiment of horse, with which he
defeated Middleton at Padbury on July 1st. In January 1644
he commanded the forces attacking Nottingham, and soon
afterwards, on Prince Rupert&rsquo;s recommendation, he was made
lieutenant-general of Newcastle&rsquo;s Northern army. When Newcastle
was shut up in York, Lucas and the cavalry remained
in the open country, and when Rupert&rsquo;s relieving army crossed
the mountains into Yorkshire he was quickly joined by Newcastle&rsquo;s
squadrons. At Marston Moor Lucas swept Fairfax&rsquo;s
Yorkshire horse before him, but later in the day he was taken
prisoner. Exchanged during the winter, he defended Berkeley
Castle for a short time against Rainsborough, but was soon in
the field again. As lieutenant-general of all the horse he
accompanied Lord Astley in the last campaign of the first war,
and, taken prisoner at Stow-on-the-Wold, he engaged not to
bear arms against parliament in the future. This parole he must
be held to have broken when he took a prominent part in the
seizure of Colchester in 1648. That place was soon invested,
and finally fell, after a desperate resistance, to Fairfax&rsquo;s army.
The superior officers had to surrender &ldquo;at mercy,&rdquo; and Lucas
and Sir George Lisle were immediately tried by court martial
and sentenced to death. The two Royalists were shot the same
evening in the Castle of Colchester.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCAS, CHARLES<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> (1713-1771), Irish physician and politician,
was the son of a country gentleman of small means in Co.
Clare. Charles opened a small business as an apothecary in
Dublin, and between 1735 and 1741 he began his career as a
pamphleteer by publishing papers on professional matters
which led to legislation requiring inspection of drugs. Having
been elected a member of the common council of Dublin in 1741
he detected and exposed encroachments by the aldermen on the
electoral rights of the citizens, and entered upon a controversy
on the subject, but failed in legal proceedings against the aldermen
in 1744. With a view to becoming a parliamentary candidate
for the city of Dublin he issued in 1748-1749 a series of
political addresses in which he advocated the principles of
Molyneux and Swift; and he made himself so obnoxious to the
government that the House of Commons voted him an enemy
to the country, and issued a proclamation for his arrest, thus
compelling him to retire for some years to the continent. Having
studied medicine at Paris, Lucas took the degree of M.D. at
Leiden in 1752. In the following year he started practice as
a physician in London, and in 1756 he published a work on
medicinal waters, the properties of which he had studied on the
continent and at Bath. The essay was reviewed by Dr Johnson,
and although it was resented by the medical profession it gained
a reputation and a considerable practice for its author. In 1760
he renewed his political pamphleteering; and having obtained
a pardon from George III., he proceeded to Dublin, where he
received a popular welcome and a Doctor&rsquo;s degree from Trinity
College. He was elected member for the city of Dublin in 1761,
his colleague in the representation being the recorder, Henry
Grattan&rsquo;s father. On the appointment of Lord Halifax as lord
lieutenant in the same year Lucas wrote him a long letter
(19th of Sept. 1761, MSS. Irish State Paper Office) setting forth
the grievances which Ireland had suffered in the past, chiefly
on account of the exorbitant pensions enjoyed by government
officials. The cause of these evils he declared to be the unrepresentative
character of the Irish constitution; and among
the remedies he proposed was the shortening of parliaments.
Lucas brought in a bill in his first session to effect this reform,
but was defeated on the motion to have the bill sent to England
for approval by the privy council; and he insisted upon the
independent rights of the Irish parliament, which were afterwards
in fuller measure successfully vindicated by Grattan.
He also defended the privileges of the Irish Protestants in the
press, and especially in the <i>Freeman&rsquo;s Journal</i>, founded in 1763.
His contributions to the press, and his <i>Addresses to the Lord
Mayor</i> and other political pamphlets made him one of the most
popular writers in Ireland of his time, although he was anti-catholic
in his prejudices, and although, as Lecky observes,
&ldquo;there is nothing in his remains to show that he possessed any
real superiority either of intellect or knowledge, or even any
remarkable brilliancy of expression.&rdquo; He died on the 4th of
November 1771, and was accorded a public funeral. As an orator
Charles Lucas appears to have had little power, and he made
no mark in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCAS, JOHN SEYMOUR<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> (1849-&emsp;&emsp;), English painter, was
born in London, and was a student in the Royal Academy
Schools. He was elected an associate of the academy in 1886
and academician in 1898, and became a constant exhibitor of
pictures of historical and domestic incidents, notably of the
Tudor and Stuart periods, painted with much skill and with
close attention to detail. One of his most important works is
a panel in the Royal Exchange, presented by the corporation
of London, representing William the Conqueror granting the

<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LUCAS VAN LEYDEN<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1494-1533), Dutch painter, was born
at Leiden, where his father Huig Jacobsz gave him the first
lessons in art. He then entered the painting-room of Cornelis
Engelbrechtszen of Leiden, and soon became known for his
capacity in making designs for glass, engraving copper-plates,
painting pictures, portraits and landscapes in oil and distemper.
According to van Mander he was born in 1494, and painted at
the age of twelve a &ldquo;Legend of St Hubert&rdquo; for which he was
paid a dozen florins. He was only fourteen when he finished
a plate representing Mahomet taking the life of Sergius, the
monk, and at fifteen he produced a series of nine plates for a
&ldquo;Passion,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Temptation of St Anthony,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Conversion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
of St Paul.&rdquo; The list of his engravings in 1510, when, according
to van Mander, he was only sixteen, includes subjects as various
as a celebrated &ldquo;Ecce Homo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Adam and Eve expelled from
Paradise,&rdquo; a herdsman and a milkmaid with three cows, and a
little naked girl running away from a barking dog. Whatever
may be thought of the tradition embodied in van Mander&rsquo;s
pages as to the true age of Lucas van Leyden, there is no doubt
that, as early as 1508, he was a master of repute as a copperplate
engraver. It was the time when art found patrons among
the public that could ill afford to buy pictures, yet had enough
interest in culture to satisfy itself by means of prints. Lucas
van Leyden became the representative man for the public
of Holland as Dürer for that of Germany; and a rivalry grew
up between the two engravers, which came to be so close that
on the neutral market of Italy the products of each were all
but evenly quoted. Vasari affirmed that Dürer surpassed
Lucas as a designer, but that in the use of the graver they
were both unsurpassed, a judgment which has not been reversed.
But the rivalry was friendly. About the time when Dürer
visited the Netherlands Lucas went to Antwerp, which then
flourished as an international mart for productions of the pencil
and the graver, and it is thought that he was the master who
took the freedom of the Antwerp gild in 1521 under the name
of Lucas the Hollander. In Dürer&rsquo;s diary kept during his travels
in the Low Countries, we find that at Antwerp he met Lucas,
who asked him to dinner, and that Dürer accepted. He valued
the art of Lucas at its true figure, and exchanged the Dutchman&rsquo;s
prints for eight florins&rsquo; worth of his own. In 1527 Lucas made a
tour of the Netherlands, giving dinners to the painters of the
gilds of Middleburg, Ghent, Malines and Antwerp. He was
accompanied during the trip by Mabuse, whom he imitated in
his style as well as in his love of rich costume. On his return
home he fell sick and remained ailing till his death in 1533, and
he believed that poison had been administered to him by some
envious comrade.</p>

<p>A few days before his death Lucas van Leyden was informed
of the birth of a grandson, first-born of his only daughter
Gretchen. Gretchen&rsquo;s fourth son <span class="sc">Jean de Hoey</span> followed the
profession of his grandfather, and became well known at the
Parisian court as painter and chamberlain to the king of France,
Henry IV.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As an engraver Lucas van Leyden deserves his reputation. He has
not the genius, nor had he the artistic tact, of Dürer; and he displays
more cleverness of expression than skill in distribution or in refinement
in details. But his power in handling the graver is great, and some
of his portraits, especially his own, are equal to anything by the
master of Nüremberg. Much that he accomplished as a painter has
been lost, because he worked a good deal upon cloth in distemper.
In 1522 he painted the &ldquo;Virgin and Child with the Magdalen and a
Kneeling Donor,&rdquo; now in the gallery of Munich. His manner was
then akin to that of Mabuse. The &ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo; in the town-gallery
of Leiden is composed on the traditional lines of Cristus and
Memling, with monsters in the style of Jerom Bosch and figures in
the stilted attitudes of the South German school; the scale of colours
in yellow, white and grey is at once pale and gaudy, the quaintest
contrasts are produced by the juxtaposition of alabaster flesh in
females and bronzed skin in males, or black hair by the side of
yellow, or rose-coloured drapery set sharply against apple-green
or black; yet some of the heads are painted with great delicacy
and modelled with exquisite feeling. Dr Waagen gave a favourable
opinion of a triptych now at the Hermitage at St Petersburg, executed,
according to van Mander, in 1531, representing the &ldquo;Blind
Man of Jericho healed by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Here too the German critic
observed the union of faulty composition with great finish and warm
flesh-tints with a gaudy scale of colours. The same defects and
qualities will be found in such specimens as are preserved in public
collections, among which may be mentioned the &ldquo;Card Party&rdquo; at
Wilton House, the &ldquo;Penitent St Jerome&rdquo; in the gallery of Berlin,
and the hermits &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anthony&rdquo; in the Liechtenstein
collection at Vienna. There is a characteristic &ldquo;Adoration of the
Magi&rdquo; at Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCCA<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> (anc. <i>Luca</i>), a town and archiepiscopal see of Tuscany,
Italy, capital of the province of Lucca, 13 m. by rail N.E. of
Pisa. Pop. (1901) 43,566 (town); 73,465 (commune). It is
situated 62 ft. above the level of the sea, in the valley of the
Serchio, and looks out for the most part on a horizon of hills
and mountains. The fortifications, pierced by four gates, were
begun in 1504 and completed in 1645, and long ranked among
the most remarkable in the peninsula. They are still well-preserved
and picturesque, with projecting bastions planted
with trees.</p>

<p>The city has a well-built and substantial appearance, its
chief attraction lying in the numerous churches, which belong
in the main to a well-marked basilican type, and present almost
too richly decorated exteriors, fine apsidal ends and quadrangular
campaniles, in some cases with battlemented summits, and
windows increasing in number as they ascend. In style they
are an imitation of the Pisan. It is remarkable that in the arcades
a pillar generally occupies the middle of the façade. The cathedral
of St Martin was begun in 1063 by Bishop Anselm (later
Pope Alexander II.); but the great apse with its tall columnar
arcades and the fine campanile are probably the only remnants
of the early edifice, the nave and transepts having been rebuilt
in the Gothic style in the 14th century, while the west front
was begun in 1204 by Guidetto (lately identified with Guido
Bigarelli of Como), and &ldquo;consists of a vast portico of three
magnificent arches, and above them three ranges of open galleries
covered with all the devices of an exuberant fancy.&rdquo; The ground
plan is a Latin cross, the nave being 273 ft. in length and 84 ft.
in width, and the transepts 144 ft. in length. In the nave is a
little octagonal temple or chapel, which serves as a shrine for the
most precious of the relics of Lucca, a cedar-wood crucifix, carved,
according to the legend, by Nicodemus, and miraculously conveyed
to Lucca in 782. The Sacred Countenance (<i>Volto Santo</i>),
as it is generally called, because the face of the Saviour is considered
a true likeness, is only shown thrice a year. The chapel
was built in 1484 by Matteo Civitali, a local sculptor of the early
Renaissance (1436-1501); he was the only master of Tuscany
outside Florence who worked thoroughly in the Florentine style,
and his creations are among the most charming works of the
Renaissance. The cathedral contains several other works by
him&mdash;the tomb of P. da Noceto, the altar of S. Regulus and the
tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by Jacopo della Quercia of Siena
(described by Ruskin in <i>Modern Painters</i>, ii.), the earliest of his
extant works (1406), and one of the earliest decorative works of
the Renaissance. In one of the chapels is a fine Madonna by Fra
Bartolommeo; in the municipal picture gallery are a fine &ldquo;God
the Father&rdquo; and another Madonna by him; also some sculptures
by Civitali, and some good wood carving, including choir stalls.
In the cathedral choir is good stained glass of 1485. The church
of St Michael, founded in the 8th century, and built of marble
within and without, has a lofty and magnificent western façade
(1188)&mdash;an architectural screen rising much above the roof of the
church. The interior is good but rather bare. The church of
St Martino at Arliano near Lucca belongs to the first half of the
8th century; it is of basilican plan (see G. T. Rivoira, <i>Origini
dell&rsquo; Architettura Lombarda</i>, iii. [Rome, 1901] 138). St Frediano
or Frigidian dates originally from the 7th century, but was built
in the Romanesque style in 1112-1147, though the interior,
originally with four aisles and nave, shows traces of the earliest
structure; the front occupies the site of the ancient apse; in one
of its chapels is the tomb of Santa Zita, patroness of servants
and of Lucca itself. In S. Francesco, a fine Gothic church, is
the tomb of Castruccio Castracane. San Giovanni (originally
of the 12th century), S. Cristoforo, San Romano (rebuilt in the
17th century, by Vincenzo Buonamici), and Santa Maria Forisportam
(of the 12th century) also deserve mention.</p>

<p>Among the secular buildings are the old ducal palace, begun
in 1578 by Ammanati, and now the residence of the prefect
and seat of the provincial officers and the public picture gallery;
the early Renaissance Palazzo Pretorio, or former residence of
the podestà, now the seat of the civil and correctional courts;
the palace, erected in the 15th century by a member of the
Guinigi family, of brick, in the Italian Gothic style, and now
serving as a poor-house; the 16th-century palace of the marquis
Guidiccioni, now used as a depository for the archives, the earliest
documents going back to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 790. The Palazzo Mansi contains
a collection of Dutch pictures. There are several other fine
late 16th-century palaces. The principal market-place in the
city (<i>Piazza del Mercato</i>) has taken possession of the arena of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
ancient amphitheatre, the outer arches of which can still be seen
in the surrounding buildings. The whole building, belonging
probably to the early Empire, measured 135 by 105 yds., and
the arena 87½ by 58 yds. The outline of the ancient theatre can
be traced in the Piazza delle Grazie, and some of its substructure
walls are preserved. The ancient forum was on the site of the
Piazza S. Michele in the centre of the town; remains of a small
public building or shrine were found not far off in 1906 (L. Pernier
in <i>Notizie degli Scavi</i>, 1906, p. 117). The rectangular disposition
of the streets in the centre of the town is a survival of Roman
times. Besides the academy of sciences, which dates from 1584,
there are several institutions of the same kind&mdash;a royal philomathic
academy, a royal academy of arts and a public library
of 50,000 volumes. The archiepiscopal library and archives are
also important, while the treasury contains some fine goldsmith&rsquo;s
work, including the 14th-century Croce dei Pisani, made by the
Pisans for the cathedral.</p>

<p>The river Serchio affords water-power for numerous factories.
The most important industries are the manufacture of jute goods
(carried on at Ponte a Moriano in the Serchio valley, 6 m. N. of
Lucca), tobacco, silks and cottons. The silk manufacture, introduced
at Lucca about the close of the 11th century, and in the
early part of the 16th the means of subsistence for 30,000 of its
inhabitants, now gives employment (in reeling and throwing)
to only about 1500. The bulk of the population is engaged in
agriculture. The water supply is maintained by an aqueduct
built in 1823-1832 with 459 arches, from the Pisan mountains.</p>

<p>The ancient Luca, commanding the valley of the Serchio, is first
mentioned as the place to which Sempronius retired in 218 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
before Hannibal; but there is some doubt as to the correctness
of Livy&rsquo;s statement, for, though there were continual wars with
the Ligurians, after this time, it is not mentioned again until we
are told that in 177 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> a Latin colony was founded there in
territory offered by the Pisans for the purpose.<a name="fa1y" id="fa1y" href="#ft1y"><span class="sp">1</span></a> It must have
become a municipium by the <i>lex Julia</i> of 90 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and it was here
that Julius Caesar in 56 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> held his famous conference with
Pompey and Crassus, Luca then being still in Liguria, not in
Etruria. A little later a colony was conducted hither by the
triumvirs or by Octavian; whether after Philippi or after Actium
is uncertain. In the Augustan division of Italy Luca was assigned
to the 7th region (Etruria); it is little mentioned in the
imperial period except as a meeting-point of roads&mdash;to Florentia
(see Clodia, Via), Luna and Pisae. The road to Parma given
in the itineraries, according to some authorities, led by Luna
and the Cisa pass (the route taken by the modern railway from
Sarzana to Parma), according to others up the Serchio valley and
over the Sassalbo pass (O. Cuntz in <i>Jahreshefte des oesterr. arch.
Instituts</i>, 1904, 53). Though plundered and deprived of part of
its territory by Odoacer, Luca appears as an important city and
fortress at the time of Narses, who besieged it for three months
in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 553, and under the Lombards it was the residence of a
duke or marquis and had the privilege of a mint. The dukes
gradually extended their power over all Tuscany, but after the
death of the famous Matilda the city began to constitute itself an
independent community, and in 1160 it obtained from Welf VI.,
duke of Bavaria and marquis of Tuscany, the lordship of all the
country for 5 m. round, on payment of an annual tribute. Internal
discord afforded an opportunity to Uguccione della Faggiuola,
with whom Dante spent some time there, to make himself
master of Lucca in 1314, but the Lucchesi expelled him two years
afterwards, and handed over their city to Castruccio Castracane,
under whose masterly tyranny it became &ldquo;for a moment the
leading state of Italy,&rdquo; until his death in 1328 (his tomb is in
S. Francesco). Occupied by the troops of Louis of Bavaria, sold
to a rich Genoese Gherardino Spinola, seized by John, king of
Bohemia, pawned to the Rossi of Parma, by them ceded to
Martino della Scala of Verona, sold to the Florentines, surrendered
to the Pisans, nominally liberated by the emperor Charles IV.
and governed by his vicar, Lucca managed, at first as a democracy,
and after 1628 as an oligarchy, to maintain &ldquo;its independence
alongside of Venice and Genoa, and painted the word
Libertas on its banner till the French Revolution.&rdquo; In the beginning
of the 16th century one of its leading citizens, Francesco
Burlamacchi, made a noble attempt to give political cohesion to
Italy, but perished on the scaffold (1548); his statue by Ulisse
Cambi was erected on the Piazza San Michele in 1863. As a
principality formed in 1805 by Napoleon in favour of his sister
Elisa and her husband Bacchiocchi, Lucca was for a few years
wonderfully prosperous. It was occupied by the Neapolitans
in 1814; from 1816 to 1847 it was governed as a duchy by Maria
Luisa, queen of Etruria, and her son Charles Louis; and it afterwards
formed one of the divisions of Tuscany.</p>

<p>The bishops of Lucca, who can be traced back to 347, received
exceptional marks of distinction, such as the pallium in 1120,
and the archiepiscopal cross from Alexander II. In 1726
Benedict XIII. raised their see to the rank of an archbishopric,
without suffragans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCCA, BAGNI DI<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> (Baths of Lucca, formerly <i>Bagno a
Corsena</i>), a commune of Tuscany, Italy, in the province of Lucca,
containing a number of famous watering-places. Pop. (1901)
13,685. The springs are situated in the valley of the Lima,
a tributary of the Serchio; and the district is known in the
early history of Lucca as the Vicaria di Val di Lima. Ponte
Serraglio (16 m. N. of Lucca by rail) is the principal village
(pop. 1312), but there are warm springs and baths also at Villa,
Docce Bassi, Bagno Caldo, &amp;c. The springs do not seem to have
been known to the Romans. Bagno a Corsena is first mentioned
in 1284 by Guidone de Corvaia, a Pisan historian (Muratori,
<i>R.I.S.</i> vol. xxii.). Fallopius, who gave them credit for the
cure of his own deafness, sounded their praises in 1569; and
they have been more or less in fashion since. The temperature
of the water varies from 98° to 130° Fahr.; in all cases it gives
off carbonic acid gas and contains lime, magnesium and sodium
products. In the village of Bagno Caldo there is a hospital
constructed largely at the expense of Nicholas Demidoff in
1826. In the valley of the Serchio, 3 m. below Ponte a Serraglio, is
the medieval Ponte del Diavolo (1322) with its lofty central arch.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCCEIUS, LUCIUS,<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> Roman orator and historian, friend and
correspondent of Cicero. A man of considerable wealth and
literary tastes, he may be compared with Atticus. Disgusted
at his failure to become consul in 60, he retired from public
life, and devoted himself to writing a history of the Social and
Civil Wars. This was nearly completed, when Cicero earnestly
requested him to write a separate history of his (Cicero&rsquo;s) consulship.
Cicero had already sung his own praises in both Greek
and Latin, but thought that a panegyric by Lucceius, who had
taken considerable interest in the affairs of that critical period,
would have greater weight. Cicero offered to supply the material,
and hinted that Lucceius need not sacrifice laudation to accuracy.
Lucceius almost promised, but did not perform. Nothing
remains of any such work or of his history. In the civil war
he took the side of Pompey; but, having been pardoned by
Caesar, returned to Rome, where he lived in retirement until his death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCCHESINI, GIROLAMO<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (1751-1825), Prussian diplomatist,
was born at Lucca on the 7th of May 1751, the eldest son of
Marquis Lucchesini. In 1779 he went to Berlin where Frederick
the Great gave him a court appointment, making use of him
in his literary relations with Italy. Frederick William II.,
who recognized his gifts for diplomacy, sent him in 1787 to Rome
to obtain the papal sanction for the appointment of a coadjutor
to the bishop of Mainz, with a view to strengthening the German
Fürstenbund. In 1788 he was sent to Warsaw, and brought
about a rapprochement with Prussia and a diminution of
Russian influence at Warsaw. He was accredited ambassador
to the king and republic of Poland on the 12th of April 1789.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
Frederick William was at that time intriguing with Turkey,
then at war with Austria and Russia. Lucchesini was to rouse
Polish feeling against Russia, and to secure for Prussia the
concourse of Poland in the event of war with Austria and Russia.
All his power of intrigue was needed in the conduct of these
hazardous negotiations, rendered more difficult by the fact that
Prussian policy excluded the existence of a strong Polish government.
A Prusso-Polish alliance was concluded in March 1790.
Lucchesini had been sent in January of that year to secure the
alliance of Saxony against Austria, and in September he was
sent to Sistova, where representatives of the chief European
powers were engaged in settling the terms of peace between
Austria and Turkey, which were finally agreed upon on the 4th
of August 1791. Before he returned to Warsaw the Polish
treaty of which he had been the chief author had become a dead
letter owing to the engagements made between Prussia and
Austria at Reichenbach in July 1790, and Prussia was already
contemplating the second partition of Poland. He was recalled
at the end of 1791, and in July 1792 he joined Frederick William
in the invasion of France. He was to be Prussian ambassador
in Paris when the allied forces should have reinstated the
authority of Louis XVI. He was opposed alike to the invasion
of France and the Austrian alliance, but his prepossessions
did not interfere with his skilful conduct of the negotiations
with Kellermann after the allies had been forced to retire by
Dumouriez&rsquo;s guns at Valmy, nor with his success in securing
the landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt&rsquo;s assistance against France.
In 1793 he was appointed ambassador to Vienna, with the
ostensible object of securing financial assistance for the Rhenish
campaign. He accompanied Frederick William through the
Polish campaign of 1793-94, and in the autumn returned to
Vienna. His anti-Austrian bias made him extremely unpopular
with the Austrian court, which asked in vain for his recall in
1795. In 1797, after a visit to Italy in which he had an interview
with Napoleon at Bologna, these demands were renewed and
acceded to. In 1800 he was sent by Frederick William III.
on a special mission to Paris. Despatches in which he expressed
his distrust of Bonaparte&rsquo;s peaceful professions and his conviction
of the danger of the continuance of a neutral policy were intercepted
by the first consul, who sought his recall, but eventually
accepted him as regular ambassador (1802). He consistently
sought friendly relations between France and Prussia, but he
warned his government in 1806 of Napoleon&rsquo;s intention of
restoring Hanover to George III. and of Murat&rsquo;s aggressions in
Westphalia. He was superseded as ambassador in Paris in
September just before the outbreak of war. After the disaster
of Jena on the 14th of October he had an interview with Duroc
near Wittenberg to seek terms of peace. After two unsuccessful
attempts at negotiation, the first draft being refused by Napoleon,
the second by Frederick William, he joined the Prussian court
at Königsberg only to learn that his services were no longer
required. He then joined the court of Elisa, grand duchess of
Tuscany, at Lucca and Florence, and after Napoleon&rsquo;s fall
devoted himself to writing. He died on the 20th of October
1825.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>He published in 1819 three volumes, <i>Sulle cause et gli effetti della
confederazione rhenana</i>, at Florence, but revealed little that was not
already available in printed sources. His memoirs remained in MS.

<p><span class="bold">LUCENA,<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> a town of southern Spain, in the province of Cordova,
37 m. S.S.E. of Cordova, on the Madrid-Algeciras railway.
Pop. (1900) 21,179. Lucena is situated on the Cascajar, a minor
tributary of the Genil. The parish church dates from the
beginning of the 16th century. The chief industries are the
manufacture of matches, brandy, bronze lamps and pottery,
especially the large earthenware jars (<i>tinajas</i>) used throughout
Spain for the storage of oil and wine, some of which hold more
than 300 gallons. There is considerable trade in agricultural
produce, and the horse fair is famous throughout Andalusia.
Lucena was taken from the Moors early in the 14th century;
it was in the attempt to recapture it that King Boabdil of
Granada was taken prisoner in 1483.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCERA,<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> a town and episcopal see of Apulia, Italy, 12½ m.
W.N.W. by rail of Foggia. Pop. (1901) 16,962. It is situated
upon a lofty plateau, the highest point of which (823 ft.), projecting
to the W., was the ancient citadel, and is occupied by
the well-preserved castle erected by Frederick II., and rebuilt
by Pierre d&rsquo;Angicourt about 1280. The cathedral, originally
Romanesque, but restored after 1300 is in the Gothic style;
the façade is good, and so is the ciborium. The interior was
restored in 1882. The town occupies the site of the ancient
Luceria, the key of the whole country. According to tradition
the temple of Minerva, founded by Diomede, contained the
Trojan Palladium, and the town struck numerous bronze coins;
but in history it is first heard of as on the Roman side in the
Samnite Wars (321 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and in 315 or 314 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> a Latin colony
was sent here. It is mentioned in subsequent military history,
and its position on the road from Beneventum, via Aecae (mod.
<i>Troja</i>) to Sipontum, gave it some importance. Its wool was
also renowned. It now contains no ancient remains above
ground, though several mosaic pavements have been found and
there are traces of the foundations of an amphitheatre outside
the town on the E. The town-hall contains a statue of Venus,
a mosaic and some inscriptions (but cf. Th. Mommsen&rsquo;s remarks
on the local neglect of antiquities in <i>Corp. Inscr. Lat.</i> ix. 75).
In 663 it was destroyed by Constans II., and was only restored
in 1223 by Frederick II., who transported 20,000 Saracens hither
from Sicily. They were at first allowed religious freedom, but
became Christians under compulsion in 1300. Up to 1806
Lucera was the capital of the provinces of Basilicata and
Molise.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCERNE<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Luzern</i>; Ital. <i>Lucerna</i>), one of the cantons
of central Switzerland. Its total area is 579.3 sq. m., of which
530.2 sq. m. are classed as &ldquo;productive&rdquo; (forests covering
120.4 sq. m., and vineyards .04 sq. m.). It contains no glaciers
or eternal snows, its highest points being the Brienzer Rothhorn
(7714 ft.) and Pilatus (6995 ft.), while the Rothstock summit
(5453 ft.) and the Kaltbad inn, both on the Rigi, are included
in the canton, the loftiest point of the Rigi range (the Kulm)
being entirely in Schwyz. The shape of the canton is an irregular
quadrilateral, due to the gradual acquisition of rural districts
by the town, which is its historical centre. The northern portion,
about 15½ sq. m., of the Lake of Lucerne is in the canton. Its
chief river is the Reuss, which flows through it for a short distance
only receiving the Kleine Emme that flows down through the
Entlebuch. In the northern part the Wigger, the Suhr and the
Wynen streams flow through shallow valleys, separated by low
hills. The canton is fairly well supplied with railways. The lakes
of Sempach and Baldegg are wholly within the canton, which
also takes in small portions of those of Hallwil and of Zug.</p>

<p>In 1900 the population numbered 146,519, of which 143,337
were German-speaking, 2204 Italian-speaking and 747 French-speaking,
while 134,020 were Romanists, 12,085 Protestants
and 319 Jews. Its capital is Lucerne (<i>q.v.</i>); the other towns
are Kriens (pop. 5951), Willisau (4131), Ruswil (3928), Littau
(3699), Emmen (3162) and Escholzmatt (3127). The peasants
are a fine race, and outside the chief centres for foreign visitors
have retained much of their primitive simplicity of manners
and many local costumes. In the Entlebuch particularly the
men are of a robust type, and are much devoted to wrestling
and other athletic exercises. That district is mainly pastoral
and is famous for its butter and cheese. Elsewhere in the canton
the pastoral industry (including swine-breeding) is more extended
than agriculture, while chiefly in and around Lucerne there are
a number of industrial establishments. The <i>industrie des étrangers</i>
is greatly developed in places frequented by foreign visitors.
The population as a whole is Conservative in politics and
devotedly Romanist in religion. But owing to the settlement of
many non-Lucerne hotel-keepers and their servants in the
town of Lucerne the capital is politically Radical.</p>

<p>The canton ranks officially third in the Swiss confederation
next after Zürich and Bern. It was formerly in the diocese of
Constance, and is now in that of Basel. It contains 5 administrative
districts and 107 communes. The existing cantonal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
constitution dates in its main features from 1875. The legislature
or <i>Grossrath</i> consists of members elected in 55 electoral circles,
in the proportion of 1 to every 1000 souls (or fraction over 500)
of the Swiss population, and lasts for 4 years. On the 4th of
April 1909 proportional representation was adopted for elections
of members of the <i>Grossrath</i>. Since 1905 the executive of 7
members is elected by a popular vote for 4 years, as are the 2
members of the federal <i>Ständerath</i> and the 7 members of the
federal <i>Nationalrath</i>. Five thousand citizens can demand a
facultative referendum as to all legislative projects and important
financial decrees, or as to the revision of the cantonal constitution,
while the same number can also revoke the mandate of the
cantonal legislature before its proper term of office has ended,
though this revocation does not affect the executive. Four
thousand citizens have the right of &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; as to constitutional
amendments or legislative projects.</p>

<p>The canton is composed of the various districts which the town
acquired, the dates being those at which the particular region
was finally secured&mdash;Weggis (1380), Rothenburg, Kriens, Horw,
Sempach and Hochdorf (all in 1394), Wolhusen and the Entlebuch
(1405), the so-called &ldquo;Habsburger region&rdquo; to the N.E. of the
town of Lucerne (1406), Willisau (1407), Sursee and Beromünster
(1415), Malters (1477) and Littau (1481), while in 1803, in
exchange for Hitzkirch, Merenschwand (held since 1397) was
given up.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCERNE,<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> the capital of the Swiss canton of the same name.
It is one of the principal tourist centres of Switzerland, being
situated on the St Gotthard railway line, by which it is 59 m.
from Basel and 180 m. from Milan. Its prosperity has always
been bound up with the St Gotthard Pass, so that the successive
improvements effected on that route (mule path in the 13th
century, carriage road 1820-1830, and railway tunnel in 1882)
have had much effect on its growth. It is beautifully situated
on the banks of the river Reuss, just as it issues from the Lake
of Lucerne, while to the south-west rises the rugged range of
Pilatus, balanced on the east by the more smiling ridge of the
Rigi and the calm waters of the lake. The town itself is very
picturesque. On the rising ground to its north still stand nine
of the towers that defended the old town wall on the Musegg
slope. The Reuss is still crossed by two quaint old wooden
bridges, the upper being the Kapellbrücke (adorned by many
paintings illustrating the history of Switzerland and the town
and clinging to the massive Wasserthurm) and the lower the
Mühlenbrücke (also with paintings, this time of the Dance of
Death). The old Hofbrücke (on the site of the Schweizerhof
quay) was removed in 1852, when the process of embanking
the shore of the lake began, the result being a splendid series
of quays, along which rise palatial hotels. The principal building
is the twin-towered Hofkirche (dedicated to St Leger or Leodegar)
which, though in its present form it dates only from 1633-1635,
was the centre round which the town gradually gathered;
originally it formed part of a Benedictine monastery, but since
1455 has been held by a college of secular canons. It has a fine
17th-century organ. The 16th-century town-hall (Rathhaus)
now houses the cantonal museum of antiquities of all dates.
Both the cantonal and the town libraries are rich in old books,
the latter being now specially devoted to works (MS. or printed)
relating to Swiss history before 1848. The Lion monument,
designed by Thorwaldsen, dedicated in 1821, and consisting of
a dying lion hewn out of the living sandstone, commemorates
the officers and men of the Swiss Guard (26 officers and about
760 men) who were slain while defending the Tuileries in Paris
in 1792, and is reflected in a clear pool at its foot. In the immediate
neighbourhood is the Glacier Garden, a series of potholes
worn in the sandstone rock bed of an ancient glacier. Among
modern buildings are the railway station, the post office and the
Museum of War and Peace, all in the new quarter on the left
bank of the Reuss. In the interior of the town are many quaint
old private houses. In 1799 the population numbered but 4337,
but had doubled by 1840. Since then the rise has been rapid
and continuous, being 29,255 in 1900. The vast majority are
German-speaking (in 1900 there were 1242 Italian-speaking and
529 French-speaking persons) and Romanists (in 1900 there
were 4933 Protestants and 299 Jews).</p>

<p>The nucleus of the town was a Benedictine monastery, founded
about 750 on the right bank of the Reuss by the abbey of Murbach
in Alsace, of which it long remained a &ldquo;cell.&rdquo; It is first mentioned
in a charter of 840 under the name of &ldquo;Luciaria,&rdquo; which
is probably derived from that of the patron saint of the monastery,
St Leger or Leodegar (in O. Ger. <i>Leudegar</i> or <i>Lutgar</i>)&mdash;the form
&ldquo;Lucerrun&rdquo; is first found in 1252. Under the shadow of this
monastery there grew up a small village. The germs of a
municipal constitution appear in 1252, while the growing power
of the Habsburgs in the neighbourhood weakened the ties that
bound Lucerne to Murbach. In 1291 the Habsburgs finally purchased
Lucerne from Murbach, an act that led a few weeks later
to the foundation of the Swiss Confederation, of which Lucerne
became the fourth member (the first town to be included) in 1332.
But it did not get rid of all traces of Habsburg domination till
after the glorious victory of Sempach (1386). That victory led
also to the gradual acquisition of territory ruled by and from
the town. At the time of the Reformation Lucerne clave to the
old faith, of which ever since it has been the great stronghold
in Switzerland. The papal nuncio resided here from 1601 to 1873.
In the 16th century, as elsewhere in Switzerland, the town
government fell into the hands of an aristocratic oligarchy,
whose power, though shaken by the great peasant revolt (1653)
in the Entlebuch, lasted till 1798. Under the Helvetic republic
(1798-1803) Lucerne was the seat of the central government,
under the Act of Mediation (1803-1814) one of the six &ldquo;Directorial&rdquo;
cantons and from 1815 to 1848 one of the three ruling
cantons. The patrician government was swept away by the
cantonal constitution of 1831. But in 1841 the Conservatives
regained power, called in the Jesuits (1844) and so brought
about the Sonderbund War (1847) in which they were defeated,
the decisive battle taking place at Gisikon, not far from Lucerne.
Since 1848 Lucerne has been in disfavour with the Radicals who
control the federal government, and has not been chosen as the
site of any great federal institution. The Radicals lost power
in the canton in 1871, after which date the Conservatives became
predominant in the canton, though in the town the Radicals
were in the majority.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCERNE, LAKE OF,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> the name usually given by foreigners
to the principal lake of Central Switzerland. In French it is
called the <i>Lac des Quatre Cantons</i>, and in German the <i>Vierwaldstättersee</i>,
this term being often wrongly translated &ldquo;Lake of the
Four Forest Cantons,&rdquo; whereas it means the &ldquo;Lake of the Four
Valleys&rdquo;&mdash;<i>valles</i>&mdash;which form the four Cantons of Lucerne,
Unterwalden, Uri and Schwyz. It takes its name from the town
of Lucerne, which is situated at its west end, just where the Reuss
issues from the lake, after having entered it at Flüelen at the east
end and so practically formed it; the Muota enters the lake
at Brunnen (northern shore) and the two mountain streams
called the Engelberg and the Sarnen Aa at Buochs and Alpnachstad
respectively (S.). The lake is generally supposed to be, on
the whole, the most beautiful in Switzerland. This is partly
due to the steep limestone mountains between which it lies,
the best known being the Rigi (5906 ft.) to the N., and Pilatus
(6995 ft.) to the S.W., and to the great promontories that thrust
themselves into its waters, such as those of Horw (S.), of Bürgenstock
(S.), of Meggenhorn (N.) and of Seelisberg (S.), and partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
to the irregularity of its shape. It is, in fact, composed of four
main basins (with two side basins), which represent four different
valleys, orographically distinct, and connected only by narrow
and tortuous channels. There is, first, the most easterly basin,
the <i>Bay of Uri</i>, extending from Flüelen on the south to Brunnen
on the north. At Brunnen the great delta of the Muota forces the
lake to the west, so that it forms the <i>Bay of Gersau</i> or the <i>Gulf
of Buochs</i>, extending from the promontory of Seelisberg (E.)
to that of the Bürgenstock (W.). Another narrow strait between
the two &ldquo;Noses&rdquo; (<i>Nasen</i>) leads westwards to the <i>Basin of Weggis</i>,
enclosed between the Rigi (N.) and the Bürgenstock promontory
(S.). This last named bay forms the eastern arm of what is called
the Cross of Lucerne, the western arm of which is formed by the
Bay of Lucerne, while the northern arm is the Bay of Küssnacht
and the southern that of <i>Hergiswil</i>, prolonged S.W. by the
<i>Bay of Alpnach</i>, with which it is joined by a very narrow channel,
spanned by the Acher iron bridge. The Bay of Uri offers the
sternest scenery, but is the most interesting, by reason of its
connexion with early Swiss history&mdash;at Brunnen the Everlasting
League of 1315 was really made, while the legendary place of
meeting of the founders of Swiss freedom was the meadow of the
Rütli on the west (purchased by the Confederation in 1859),
and the site of Tell&rsquo;s leap is marked by the Chapel of Tell (E.).
Nearly opposite Brunnen, close to the west shore, an isolated
rock (the <i>Schillerstein</i> or <i>Mythenstein</i>) now bears an inscription
in honour of Friedrich Schiller, the author of the famous play of
<i>William Tell</i> (1804). In the Bay of Gersau the most interesting
spot is the village of Gersau (N.), which formed an independent
republic from 1390 to 1798, but in 1818 was finally united to the
canton of Schwyz. In the next basin to the west is Weggis (N.),
also for long in the middle ages a small independent state;
to the S.E. of Weggis, on the north shore of the lake, is Vitznau,
whence a rack railway (1871) leads up to the top of the Rigi
(4¼ m.), while S.W. of Weggis, on the south shore of the lake,
is Kehrsiten, whence an electric railway leads up to the great
hotels on the Bürgenstock promontory (2854 ft.). The town
of Lucerne is connected with Flüelen by the main line of the
St Gotthard railway (32 m.), though only portions of this line
(from Lucerne to Küssnacht, 10½ m., and from Brunnen to
Flüelen, 7 m.) run along the shore; Brunnen is also connected
with Flüelen by the splendid carriage road known as the Axenstrasse
(7¼ m.) and is the starting-point of an electric line (1905)
up to Morschach (S.E.) and the great hotels of Axenstein and
Axenfels near it. On the promontory between Lucerne and
Küssnacht stands the castle of New Habsburg (modern), while
from Küssnacht a carriage road leads through the remains of the
&ldquo;Hollow Way&rdquo; (<i>Hohle Gasse</i>), the scene of the legendary murder
of Gessler by William Tell. The west shore of the southern arm,
or the basin of Hergiswil and the Bay of Alpnach, is traversed
from Horw to Alpnachstad by the Brünig railway (5½ m.), which
continues towards Sarnen (Obwalden) and the Bernese Oberland,
S.W. from Alpnachstad, whence a rack railway leads N.W. up
Pilatus (2¾ m.). Opposite Hergiswil, but on the east shore of
the Basin of Hergiswil, is Stanstad, the port of Stans (Nidwalden),
which is connected by an electric line with Engelberg (14 m.).
The first steamer was placed on the lake in 1835. Lucerne is the
only town of importance, but several spots serve as ports for
neighbouring towns or large villages (Brunnen for Schwyz,
Flüelen for Altdorf, Stanstad for Stans, Alpnachstad for Sarnen).
Most of the villages on the shores are frequented in summer by
visitors (Gersau also in winter), especially Hertenstein, Weggis,
Gersau, Brunnen, Beckenried and Hergiswil, while great hotels,
commanding magnificent views, have been built on heights above
it, such as the Bürgenstock, Seelisberg, and near Morschach,
above Brunnen, besides those on the Rigi, Pilatus and the
Stanserhorn. The area of the lake is about 44½ sq. m., its length
about 24 m., its greatest width only 2 m. and its greatest depth
702 ft., while the surface of the water is 1434 ft. above sea-level.
Of the total area about 15½ sq. m. are in the Canton of Lucerne,
13 sq. m. in that of Nidwalden, 7½ sq. m. in that of Uri,
7½ sq. m. in that of Schwyz, and about 1 sq. m. in that of
Obwalden.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCERNE,<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> <span class="sc">Purple Medick</span> or <span class="sc">Alfalfa</span>, known botanically
as <i>Medicago sativa</i>, a plant of the natural order Leguminosae.
In England it is still commonly called &ldquo;lucerne,&rdquo; but in America
&ldquo;alfalfa,&rdquo; an Arabic term (&ldquo;the best fodder&rdquo;), which, owing to
its increasing cultivation in the western hemisphere, has come
into widening usage since the introduction of the plant by the
Spaniards. It is an erect perennial herb with a branched hollow
stem 1 to 2 ft. high, trifoliolate leaves, short dense racemes of
small yellow, blue or purple flowers, and downy pods coiled
two or three times in a loose
spiral. It has a characteristic
long tap-root, often extending 15
ft. or more into the soil. It is
a native of the eastern Mediterranean
region, but was introduced
into Italy in the 1st
century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, and has become
more widely naturalized in
Europe; it occurs wild in hedges
and fields in Britain, where it
was first cultivated about 1650.
It seems to have been taken
from Spain to Mexico and South
America in the 16th century,
but the extension of its cultivation
in the Western States of
the American Union practically
dates from the middle of the
19th century, and in Argentina
its development as a staple crop
is more recent. It is much cultivated
as a forage crop in France
and other parts of the continent
of Europe, but has not come
into such general use in Britain,
where, however, it is frequently
met with in small patches in
districts where the soil is very
light, with a dry subsoil. Its
thick tap-roots penetrate very
deeply into the soil; and, if a
good cover is once obtained, the
plants will yield abundant cuttings
of herbage for eight or ten years, provided they are properly
top-dressed and kept free from perennial weeds. The time to
cut it is, as with clover and sainfoin, when it is in early flower.</p>

<p>In the United States alfalfa has become the staple leguminous
forage crop throughout the western half of the country. Some
idea of the increase in its cultivation may be obtained from the
figures for Kansas, where in 1891 alfalfa was cultivated over
34,384 acres, while in 1907 the number was 743,050. The progress
of irrigation has been an important factor in many districts.
The plant requires a well-drained soil (deep and permeable
as possible), rich in lime and reasonably free from weeds.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCHAIRE, DENIS JEAN ACHILLE<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> (1846-1908), French
historian, was born in Paris on the 24th of October 1846. In
1879 he became a professor at Bordeaux and in 1889 professor
of medieval history at the Sorbonne; in 1895 he became a
member of the <i>Académie des sciences morales et politiques</i>, where
he obtained the Jean Reynaud prize just before his death on the
14th of November 1908. The most important of Achille
Luchaire&rsquo;s earlier works is his <i>Histoire des institutions monarchiques
de la France sous les premiers Capétiens</i> (1883 and again 1891);
he also wrote a <i>Manuel des institutions françaises: période des
Capétiens directs</i> (1892); <i>Louis VI. le Gros, annales de sa vie
et de son règne</i> (1890); and <i>Étude sur les actes de Louis VII.</i>
(1885). His later writings deal mainly with the history of
the papacy, and took the form of an elaborate work on Pope
Innocent III. This is divided into six parts: (1.) <i>Rome et Italie</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
(1904); (ii.) <i>La Croisade des Albigeois</i> (1905); (iii.) <i>La Papauté et

<p><span class="bold">LUCHU ARCHIPELAGO<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> (called also <span class="sc">Riukiu</span>, <span class="sc">Loo-choo</span> and
<span class="sc">Liukiu</span>), a long chain of islands belonging to Japan, stretching
from a point 80 m. S. of Kiushiu to a point 73 m. from the N.E.
coast of Formosa, and lying between 24° and 30° N. and 123°
and 130° E. Japanese cartographers reckon the Luchu islands
as 55, having a total coast-line of 768 m., an area of 935 sq. m.,
and a population of about 455,000. They divide them into
three main groups, of which the northern is called Oshima-shoto;
the central, Okinawa-gunto; and the southern, Sakishima-retto.
The terms <i>shoto</i>, <i>gunto</i> and <i>retto</i> signify &ldquo;archipelago,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cluster of islands&rdquo; and &ldquo;string of islands&rdquo; respectively.
The last-named group is subdivided into Miyako-gunto and
Yayeyama-gunto. The principal islands of these various
groups are:&mdash;</p>

<p>The remaining islands of the archipelago are of very small
size, although often thickly populated. Almost at the extreme
north of the chain are two islands with active volcanoes:
Nakano-shima (3485 ft.) and Suwanose-shima (2697 ft.), but
the remaining members of the group give no volcanic indications,
and the only other mountain of any size is Yuwan-dake
(2299 ft.) in Amami-Oshima. The islands &ldquo;are composed chiefly
of Palaeozoic rocks&mdash;limestones and quartzites found in the west,
and clay, slate, sandstone and pyroxenite or amphibolite on
the east.... Pre-Tertiary rocks have been erupted through
these. The outer sedimentary zone is of Tertiary rocks.&rdquo;<a name="fa1z" id="fa1z" href="#ft1z"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
The capital is Shuri in Okinawa, an old-fashioned place with a
picturesque castle. The more modern town of Nafa, on the same
island, possesses the principal harbour and has considerable
trade.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The scenery of Luchu is unlike that of Japan. Though so close
to the tropics, the islands cannot be said to present tropical features:
the bamboo is rare; there is no high grass or tangled undergrowth;
open plains are numerous; the trees are not crowded together;
lakes are wanting; the rivers are insignificant; and an unusual
aspect is imparted to the scenery by numerous coral crags. The
temperature in Nafa ranges from a mean of 82° F. in July to 60° in
January. The climate is generally (though not in all the islands)
pleasant and healthy, in spite of much moisture, the rainfall being
very heavy.</p>

<p>The fauna includes wild boars and deer, rats and bats. Excellent
small ponies are kept, together with cattle, pigs and goats. The
majority of the islands are infested with venomous snakes called
<i>habu</i> (<i>Trimeresurus</i>), which attain a length of 6 to 7 ft. and a diameter
of from 2½ to 3 in. Their bite generally causes speedy death, and in
the island of Amami-Oshima they claim many victims every year.
The most important cultivated plant is the sugar-cane, which provides
the principal staple of trade.</p>

<p>Luchu is noted for the production of particularly durable vermilion-coloured
lacquer, which is much esteemed for table utensils in Japan.
The islands also manufacture certain fabrics which are considered a
speciality. These are <i>Riukiu-tsumugi</i>, a kind of fine pongee; the so-called
<i>Satsuma-gasuri</i>, a cotton fabric greatly used for summer wear;
<i>basho-fu</i>, or banana-cloth (called also <i>aka-basho</i>), which is woven
from the fibre of a species of banana; and <i>hoso-jofu</i>, a particularly
fine hempen stuff, made in Miyako-shima, and demanding such
difficult processes that six months are required to weave and dye a
piece 9½ yds. long.</p>

<p><i>People.</i>&mdash;Although the upper classes in Luchu and Japan closely
resemble each other, there are palpable differences between the lower
classes, the Luchuans being shorter and better proportioned than
the Japanese; having higher foreheads, eyes not so deeply set, faces
less flattened, arched and thick eyebrows, better noses, less marked
cheek-bones and much greater hairiness. The last characteristic has
been attributed to the presence of Ainu blood, and has suggested a
theory that when the Japanese race entered south-western Japan
from Korea, they drove the Ainu northwards and southwards, one
portion of the latter finding their way to Luchu, the other to Yezo.
Women of the upper class never appear in public in Luchu, and are
not even alluded to in conversation, but women of the lower orders
go about freely with uncovered faces. The Luchu costume resembles
that of Japan, the only marked difference being that the men use
two hairpins, made of gold, silver, pewter or wood, according to the
rank of the wearer. Men shave their faces until the age of twenty-five,
after which moustache and beard are allowed to grow, though the
cheeks are kept free from hair. Their burial customs are peculiar
and elaborate, and their large sepulchres, generally mitre-shaped,
and scattered all over the country, according to Chinese fashion,
form a striking feature of the landscape. The marriage customs are
also remarkable. Preliminaries are negotiated by a middleman, as
in China and Japan, and the subsequent procedure extends over
several days. The chief staple of the people&rsquo;s diet is the sweet
potato, and pork is the principal luxury. An ancient law, still in
force, requires each family to keep four pigs. In times of scarcity a
species of sago (obtained from the <i>Cycas revoluta</i>) is eaten. There is a
remarkable absence of religious influence in Luchu. Places of worship
are few, and the only function discharged by Buddhist priests seems
to be to officiate at funerals. The people are distinguished by gentleness,
courtesy and docility, as well as by marked avoidance of crime.
With the exception of petty thefts, their Japanese administrators find
nothing to punish, and for nearly three centuries no such thing
as a lethal weapon has been known in Luchu. Professor Chamberlain
states that the Luchuan language resembles the Japanese in
about the same degree as Italian resembles French, and says that
they are sister tongues, many words being identical, others differing
only by letter changes which follow certain fixed analogies, and
sentences in the one being capable of translation into the other word
for word, almost syllable for syllable.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Tinsunshi, &ldquo;Grandson of Heaven,&rdquo; is the mythical
founder of the Luchu monarchy. Towards the close of the 12th
century his descendants were driven from the throne by rebellion,
but the old national party soon found a victorious leader in
Shunten, son of Tametomo, a member of the famous Minamoto
family, who, having been expelled from Japan, had come to
Luchu and married there. The introduction of the arts of reading
and writing are assigned to Shunten&rsquo;s reign. Chinese invasions
of Luchu may be traced back to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 605, but they did not result
in annexation; and it was in 1372 that China first obtained from
the Luchuans recognition of supremacy. Luchuan relations
with Japan had long been friendly, but at the end of the 16th
century the king refused Japan assistance against Korea, and in
1609 the prince of Satsuma invaded the islands with 3000 men,
took the capital by storm, captured the king and carried him off
to Kagoshima. A few years later he was restored to his throne
on condition of acknowledging Japanese suzerainty and paying
tribute. The Luchuans nevertheless continued to pay tribute
to China also.</p>

<p>The Chinese government, however, though taking a benevolent
interest in the welfare of the islanders, never attempted to bring
them under military sway. The incongruity of this state of
affairs did not force itself upon Japan&rsquo;s attention so long as her
own empire was divided into a number of semi-independent
principalities. But in 1879 the Japanese government, treating
Luchu as an integral part of the mikado&rsquo;s dominions, dethroned
its prince, pensioned him as the other feudal chiefs had been
pensioned, and converted Luchu into a prefecture under the name
of Okinawa. This name signifies &ldquo;extended rope,&rdquo; and alludes
to the attenuated nature of the archipelago. China remonstrating,
a conference was held in Peking, when plenipotentiaries of
the two empires signed an agreement to the effect that the
archipelago should be divided equally between the claimants.
The Chinese government, however, refused to ratify this compromise,
and the Japanese continued their measures for the
effective administration of all the islands. Ultimately (1895)
Formosa also came into Japan&rsquo;s possession, and her title to the
whole chain of islands ceased to be disputed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span></p>

<p>Though Captain Broughton, of H.M.S. &ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; was
wrecked on Miyako-shima and subsequently visited Nafa in
1797, it was not till the &ldquo;Alceste&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lyra&rdquo; expedition
in 1816-1817, under Captains Basil Hall and Murray Maxwell,
that detailed information was obtained about Luchu. The
people at that time showed a curious mixture of courtesy and
shyness. From 1844 efforts were made by both Catholic (French)
and Protestant missionaries to Christianize them, but though
hospitable they made it clear that these efforts were unwelcome.
Further visits were made by British vessels under Captain
Beechey (1826) and Sir Edward Belcher (1845). The American
expedition under Commodore M. C. Perry (1853) added largely
to knowledge of the islands, and concluded a treaty with the
Luchuan government.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCIA<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Lucy</span>), <span class="bold">ST,</span> virgin and martyr of Syracuse, whose
name figures in the canon of the mass, and whose festival
is celebrated on the 13th of December. According to the legend,
she lived in the reign of Diocletian. Her mother, having been
miraculously cured of an illness at the sepulchre of St Agatha
in Catania, was persuaded by Lucia to distribute all her wealth
to the poor. The youth to whom the daughter had been betrothed
forthwith denounced her to Pascasius, the prefect, who ordered
that she should be taken away and subjected to shameful outrage.
But it was found that no force which could be applied was able
to move her from the spot on which she stood; even boiling oil
and burning pitch had no power to hurt her, until at last she was
slain with the sword. The most important documents concerning
St Lucy are the mention in the <i>Martyrologium Hieronymianum</i>
and the ancient inscription discovered at Syracuse, in which
her festival is indicated. Many paintings represent her bearing
her eyes in her hand or on a salver. Some artists have even
represented her blind, but nothing in her <i>Acta</i> justifies this
representation. It is probable that it originated in a play upon
words (Lucia, from Lat. <i>lux</i>, light), just as St Clair is invoked
in cases of eye-disease.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCIAN<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> (d. 312), Christian martyr, was born, like the famous,
heathen writer of the same name, at Samosata. His parents,
who were Christians, died when he was in his twelfth year.
In his youth he studied under Macarius of Edessa, and after
receiving baptism he adopted a strictly ascetic life, and devoted
himself with zeal to the continual study of scripture. Settling
at Antioch when Malchion was master of the Greek school he
became a presbyter, and, while supporting himself by his skill
as a rapid writer, became celebrated as a teacher, so that he is
regarded as the founder of the famous theological school of
Antioch. He did not escape suspicion of heresy, and is represented
as the connecting link between Paul of Samosata and
Arius. Indeed, on the deposition of the former (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 268) he
was excluded from ecclesiastical fellowship by three successive
bishops of Antioch, while Arius seems to have been among his
pupils (Theodoret, <i>Hist. Eccl.</i> i. 3, 4). He was, however, restored
before the outbreak of persecution, and the reputation won
by his high character and learning was confirmed by his courageous
martyrdom. He was carried to Nicomedia before Maximin
Daza, and persisting in his faith perished on the 7th of January
312, under torture and hunger, which he refused to satisfy with
food offered to idols. His defence is preserved by Rufinus
(ix. 6; on Eusebius, <i>Hist. Eccl.</i> ix. 9). His remains were
conveyed to Drepanum in Bithynia, and under Constantine
the town was founded anew in his honour with the name of
Helenopolis, and exempted from taxes by the emperor (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 327)
(see <i>Chron. Pasch.</i>, Bonn ed., p. 527). Here in 387, on the anniversary
of his death, Chrysostom delivered the panegyrical
homily from which, with notices in Eusebius, Theodoret and the
other ecclesiastical historians, the life by Jerome (<i>Vir. Ill.</i> cap.
77), but especially from the account by S. Metaphrastes (cited
at length in Bernhardy&rsquo;s notes to Suidas, <i>s.v.</i> <span class="grk" title="notheuei">&#957;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;</span>), the facts
above given are derived. See also, for the celebration of his day
in the Syriac churches, Wright, <i>Cat. of Syr.</i> MSS. p. 283.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Jerome says that Lucian wrote <i>Libelli de fide</i> and several letters,
but only a short fragment of one epistle remains (<i>Chron. Pasch.</i>, ed.
Dindorf, i. 516). The authorship of a confession of faith ascribed to
Lucian and put forth at the semi-Arian synod of Antioch (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 341)
is questioned. Lucian&rsquo;s most important literary labour was his
edition of the Greek Old Testament corrected by the Hebrew text,
which, according to Jerome (<i>Adv. Ruf.</i> ii. 77), was in current use
from Constantinople to Antioch. That the edition of Lucian is
represented by the text used by Chrysostom and Theodoret, as well
as by certain extant MSS., such as the Arundelian of the British
Museum, was proved by F. Field (<i>Prol. ad Origenis Hexapla</i>, cap. ix.).</p>

<p>Before the publication of Field&rsquo;s <i>Hexapla</i>, Lagarde had already
directed his attention to the Antiochian text (as that of Lucian may
be called) and ultimately published the first part (Genesis, 2 Esdras,
Esther) of a provisional reconstructed text. The distinguishing
marks of the Lucianic recension are thus summarized by S. R.
Driver, <i>Notes on Heb. Text of Samuel</i>, p. li. seq.: (1) The substitution
of synonyms for the words employed by the Septuagint; (2) the
occurrence of double renderings; (3) the occurrence of renderings
&ldquo;which presuppose a Hebrew original self-evidently superior in the
passages concerned to the existing Massoretic text,&rdquo; a peculiarity
which makes it very important for the criticism of the Hebrew Bible.
From a statement of Jerome in his preface to the gospels it seems
probable that Lucian had also a share in fixing the Syrian recension
of the New Testament text, but of this it is impossible to speak with
certainty. He was associated in his work with the Hebraist
Dorotheus.</p>

vol. xi., and for &ldquo;remains&rdquo; Routh, Rel. Sac. iv. 3-17. A full account
of his recension of the Septuagint is given in H. B. Swete&rsquo;s <i>Introduction
to the Old Testament in Greek</i>, p. 81 sqq.; and a good account of his
doctrinal position in the prolegomena to the volume on <i>Athanasius</i>

<p><span class="bold">LUCIAN<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> [<span class="grk" title="Loukianos">&#923;&#959;&#965;&#954;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span>] (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 120-180), Greek satirist of the
Silver Age of Greek literature, was born at Samosata on the
Euphrates in northern Syria. He tells us in the <i>Somnium</i> or
<i>Vita Luciani</i>, 1, that, his means being small, he was at first
apprenticed to his maternal uncle, a statuary, or rather sculptor
of the stone pillars called Hermae. Having made an unlucky
beginning by breaking a marble slab, and having been well
beaten for it, he absconded and returned home. Here he had
a dream or vision of two women, representing Statuary and
Literature. Both plead their cause at length, setting forth the
advantages and the prospects of their respective professions;
but the youth chooses <span class="grk" title="Paideia">&#928;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>, and decides to pursue learning.
For some time he seems to have made money as a <span class="grk" title="rhêtôr">&#8165;&#942;&#964;&#969;&#961;</span>, following
the example of Demosthenes, on whose merits and patriotism
he expatiates in the dialogue <i>Demosthenis Encomium</i>. He was
very familiar with the rival schools of philosophy, and he must
have well studied their teachings; but he lashes them all alike,
the Cynics, perhaps, being the chief object of his derision. Lucian
was not only a sceptic; he was a scoffer and a downright unbeliever.
He felt that men&rsquo;s actions and conduct always fall
far short of their professions and therefore he concluded that the
professions themselves were worthless, and a mere guise to secure
popularity or respect. Of Christianity he shows some knowledge,
and it must have been somewhat largely professed in Syria at
the close of the 2nd century.<a name="fa1aa" id="fa1aa" href="#ft1aa"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In the <i>Philopatris</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), though
the dialogue so called is generally regarded as spurious, there
is a statement of the doctrine of the Trinity,<a name="fa2aa" id="fa2aa" href="#ft2aa"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and the &ldquo;Galilaean
who had ascended to the third heaven&rdquo; (12), and &ldquo;renewed&rdquo;
(<span class="grk" title="anekainisen">&#7936;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span>) by the waters of baptism, may possibly allude
to St Paul. The doctrines of the <span class="grk" title="Logos">&#923;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> and the &ldquo;Light of the
world,&rdquo; and that God is in heaven making a record of the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
and bad actions of men,<a name="fa3aa" id="fa3aa" href="#ft3aa"><span class="sp">3</span></a> seem to have come from the same
source, though the notion of a written catalogue of human
actions to be used in judgment was familiar to Aeschylus and
Euripides.</p>

<p>As a satirist and a wit Lucian occupies in prose literature
the unique position which Aristophanes holds in Greek poetry.
But whether he is a mere satirist, who laughs while he lashes,
or a misanthrope, who hates while he derides, is not very clear.
In favour of the former view it may be said that the two main
objects of his ridicule are mythology and the sects of philosophy;
in favour of the latter, his bitter exposure of imposture and
chicanery in the <i>Alexander</i>, and the very severe attacks he
makes on the &ldquo;humbug&rdquo; of philosophy,<a name="fa4aa" id="fa4aa" href="#ft4aa"><span class="sp">4</span></a> which he everywhere
assails with the most acrimonious and contemptuous epithets.</p>

<p>As a writer Lucian is fluent, easy and unaffected, and a close
follower of the best Attic models, such as Plato and the orators.
His style is simpler than Plutarch&rsquo;s, and some of his compositions,
especially the <i>Dialogues of the Gods</i> (pp. 204-287) and <i>of the
Marine Deities</i> (288-327), and, above all, the <i>Dialogues of the
Dead</i> (329-454), are models of witty, polished and accurate Greek
composition. Not less clever, though rather lax in morality,
are the <span class="grk" title="hetairikoi dialogoi">&#7953;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#943; &#948;&#953;&#940;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span> (pp. 280-325), which remind us
somewhat of the letters of Alciphron. The sarcasms on the
popular mythology, the conversations of Pluto, Hermes, Charon
and others of the powers in Hades, show a positive disbelief
in any future state of existence. The model Lucian followed
in these dialogues, as well in the style as in the sparkling and
playful repartee, was the Platonic conversations, founded on the
drama, of which the dialogue may be called the prose representative.
Aristotle never adopted it, perhaps regarding it as
beneath the true dignity of philosophy. The dialogue, in fact,
was revived and improved by Lucian,<a name="fa5aa" id="fa5aa" href="#ft5aa"><span class="sp">5</span></a> the old traditions of the
<span class="grk" title="logopoioi">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#943;</span> and <span class="grk" title="logographoi">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#953;</span>, and, above all, the immense influence
of rhetoric as an art, having thrown some discredit on a style
of composition which, as introduced by Plato, had formed quite
a new era in Greek prose composition. For rhetoric loved to
talk, expatiate and declaim, while dialectic strove to refute
by the employment of question and answer, often in the briefest
form.</p>

<p>Lucian evinces a perfect mastery over a language as wonderful
in its inflections as in its immense and varied vocabulary; and
it is a well-merited praise of the author to say that to a good
Greek scholar the pages of Lucian are almost as easy and as entertaining
as an English or French novel. It is true that he employs
some forms and compounds which were not in use in the time of
Plato or Demosthenes, and, as one who lived under Roman
rule, has a tendency towards Latinisms. But his own sentiments
on the propriety of diction are shown by his reproof to Lexiphanes,
&ldquo;if anywhere you have picked up an out-of-the-way word, or
coined one which you think good, you labour to adapt the sense
of it, and think it a loss if you do not succeed in dragging it in
somewhere, even when it is not really wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucian founded his style, or obtained his fluency, from the
successful study of rhetoric, by which he appears to have made
a good income from composing speeches which attracted much
attention. At a later period in life he seems to have held a
lucrative legal office in Egypt, which he retained till his death.</p>

<p>His extant works are so numerous that of some of the principal
only a short sketch can be given. More than 80 pieces have
come down to us under his name (including three collections
of 71 shorter dialogues), of which about 20 are spurious or of
doubtful authorship. To understand them aright we must
remember that the whole moral code, the entire &ldquo;duty of man,&rdquo;
was included, in the estimation of the pagan Greek, in the
various schools of philosophy. As these were generally rivals,
and the systems they taught were more or less directly antagonistic,
truth presented itself to the inquirer, not as one, but as
manifold. The absurdity and the impossibility of this forms
the burden of all Lucian&rsquo;s writings. He could only form one
conclusion, viz. that there is no such thing as truth.</p>

<p>One of the best written and most amusing treatises of antiquity
is Lucian&rsquo;s <i>True History</i>, forming a rather long narrative in two
books, which suggested Swift&rsquo;s <i>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</i>, Rabelais&rsquo;s
<i>Voyage of Pantagruel</i> and Cyrano de Bergerac&rsquo;s <i>Journey to
the Moon</i>. It is composed, the author tells us in a brief introduction,
not only as a pastime and a diversion from severer
studies, but avowedly as a satire on the poets and logographers
who had written so many marvellous tales. He names Ctesias
and Homer; but Hellanicus and Herodotus, perhaps other
<span class="grk" title="logopoioi">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#943;</span> still earlier, appear to have been in his mind.<a name="fa6aa" id="fa6aa" href="#ft6aa"><span class="sp">6</span></a> The
only true statement in his <i>History</i>, he wittily says (p. 72), is that
it contains nothing but lies from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The main purport of the story is to describe a voyage to the
moon. He set out, he tells us, with fifty companions, in a well-provisioned
ship, from the &ldquo;Pillars of Hercules,&rdquo; intending to
explore the western ocean. After eighty days&rsquo; rough sailing they
came to an island on which they found a Greek inscription, &ldquo;This
was the limit of the expedition of Heracles and Dionysus&rdquo;;
and the visit of the wine-god seemed attested by some miraculous
vines which they found there. After leaving the island they
were suddenly carried up, ship and all, by a whirlwind into the
air, and on the eighth day came in sight of a great round island
shining with a bright light (p. 77), and lying a little above the
moon. In a short time they are arrested by a troop of gigantic
&ldquo;horse-vultures&rdquo; and brought as captives to the &ldquo;man in the
moon,&rdquo; who proves to be Endymion. He is engaged in a war
with the inhabitants of the sun, which is ruled by King Phaëthon,
the quarrel having arisen from an attempt to colonize the planet
Venus (Lucifer). The voyagers are enlisted as &ldquo;Moonites,&rdquo;
and a long description follows of the monsters and flying dragons
engaged in the contest. A fight ensues, in which the slaughter
is so great that the very clouds are tinged with red (p. 84). The
long description of the inhabitants of the moon is extremely
droll and original. After descending safely into the sea, the ship is
swallowed by a huge &ldquo;sea serpent&rdquo; more than 100 miles long.
The adventures during the long confinement in the creature&rsquo;s
belly are most amusing; but at last they sail out through the
chinks between the monster&rsquo;s teeth, and soon find themselves
at the &ldquo;Fortunate Islands.&rdquo; Here they meet with the spirits
of heroes and philosophers of antiquity, on whom the author
expatiates at some length. The tale comes to an abrupt end
with an allusion to Herodotus in the promise that he &ldquo;will tell
the rest in his next books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another curious and rather long treatise is entitled <span class="grk" title="Loukios hê
Onos">&#923;&#959;&#973;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7972; &#8012;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, the authorship of which is regarded as doubtful. Parts
of the story are coarse enough; the point turns on one Lucius
visiting in a Thessalian family, in which the lady of the house
was a sorceress. Having seen her changed into a bird by anointing
herself with some potent drug, he resolves to try a similar
experiment on himself, but finds that he has become an ass,
retaining, however, his human senses and memory. The mistake
arose from his having filched the wrong ointment; however, he
is assured by the attendant, Palaestra, that if he can but procure
roses to eat, his natural form will be restored. In the night a
party of bandits break into the house and carry off the stolen
goods into the mountains on the back of the unfortunate donkey,
who gets well beaten for stumbling on the rough road. Seeing,
as he fancies, some roses in a garden, he goes in quest of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
and again gets beaten as a thief by the gardener (p. 585). After
many adventures with the bandits, he attempts to run away,
but is caught. A council is held, and he is condemned to die
together with a captive girl who had essayed to escape on his
back. Suddenly, however, soldiers appear, and the bandits
are arrested (p. 595). Again the ass escapes &ldquo;to the great and
populous city of Beroea in Macedonia&rdquo; (p. 603). Here he is sold
to a strolling conjurer, afterwards to a market-gardener; and
both experiences are alike painful. Again he passes into the
possession of a cook, where he gets fat and sleek on food more
suited to his concealed humanity than the hard fare he has of
late lived upon (p. 614). At last, during an exhibition in the
theatre, he sees some roses being carried past, and, making
a successful rush to devour them, he recovers his former shape.
&ldquo;I am Lucius,&rdquo; he exclaims to the wondering president of the
exhibition, &ldquo;and my brother&rsquo;s name is Caius. It was a Thessalian
witch that changed me into a donkey.&rdquo; Thus all ends
well, and he returns safe to his country.</p>

<p>The treatise <i>On the Syrian Goddess</i> (Mylitta, the moon-goddess,
the Semitic Aphrodite) is written in the Ionic dialect in imitation
perhaps of the style of Herodotus, though the resemblance
is by no means close. The writer professes to be an Assyrian
(p. 452), and to describe the wonders in the various temples of
Palestine and Syria; he descants on the eunuchs of Syria and
the origin of the self-imposed privation of manhood professed
and practised by the Galli. The account of the temples, altars
and sacrifices is curious, if really authentic; after the manner
of Pausanias it is little more than a list, with the reasons in most
cases added, or the origin of the custom explained.</p>

<p><i>De Morte Peregrini</i> is a narrative of one Proteus, a Cynic, who
after professing various doctrines, and among them those of
Christianity, ended his own life by ascending a burning pyre
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peregrinus Proteus</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Bis accusatus</i> (&ldquo;Twice Accused&rdquo;) is a dialogue beginning
with a satire on the folly of the popular notion that the gods
alone are happy. Zeus is represented as disproving this by
enumerating the duties that fall to their lot in the government
of the world, and Hermes remarks on the vast crowds of philosophers
of rival sects, by whose influence the respect and worship
formerly paid to the gods have seriously declined. A trial is
supposed to be held under the presidency of the goddess <span class="grk" title="Dikê">&#916;&#943;&#954;&#951;</span>,
between the Academy, the Porch, the schools of the Cynics and
Epicureans, and Pleasure, Revelry, Virtue, Luxury, &amp;c., as
variously impugned or defended by them. Then Conversation
and Rhetoric come before the court, each having an action for
defamation to bring against Syrus the essayist, who of course is
Lucian himself (p. 823). His defence is heard, and in both cases
he is triumphantly acquitted. This essay is brilliant from its
clever parodies of Plato and Demosthenes, and the satire on the
Socratic method of arguing by short questions and answers.</p>

<p>The <i>Lover of Lying</i> (<span class="grk" title="Philopseudês">&#934;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#968;&#949;&#973;&#948;&#951;&#962;</span>) discusses the reason why some
persons seem to take pleasure in falsehood for its own sake.
Under the category of lying all mythology (<i>e.g.</i> that of Homer
and Hesiod) is included, and the question is asked, why the
hearers of such stories are amused by them? Quack remedies,
charms and miraculous cures are included among the most
popular kinds of falsehood; witchcraft, spiritualism, exorcism,
expulsion of devils, spectres, are discussed in turn, and a good
ghost story is told in p. 57. An anecdote is given of Democritus,
who, to show his disbelief in ghosts, had shut himself up in a
tomb, and when some young men, dressed up with death&rsquo;s
heads, came to frighten him at night, he did not even look up,
but called out to them, &ldquo;Stop your joking&rdquo; (p. 59). This
treatise, a very interesting one, concludes with the reflection that
truth and sound reason are the only remedies for vain and
superstitious terrors.</p>

<p>The dialogue <i>Navigium seu Vota</i> (&ldquo;The Ship or the Wishes&rdquo;)
gives an apparently authentic account of the measurements and
fittings of an Egyptian ship which has arrived with a cargo of
corn at the Peiraeus, driven out of its course to Italy by adverse
winds. The full length is 180 ft., the breadth nearly 50, the
depth from deck to the bottom of the hold 43 ft. The &ldquo;wishes&rdquo;
turn on a party of friends, who have been to see the ship, declaring
what they would most desire to possess. One would have the
ship filled with gold, another a fine house with gold plate; a
third would be a &ldquo;tyrant&rdquo; with a large force devoted to his
interests; a fourth would like to make himself invisible, enter
any house that he pleased, and be transported through the air
to the objects of his affection. After hearing them all, the first
speaker, Lycinus (Lucian), says that he is content with the
privilege of laughing heartily at the vanity of human wishes,
especially when they are those of professed philosophers.</p>

<p>The dialogue between Philo and Lycinus, <i>Convivium seu
Lapithae</i>, is a very amusing description of a banquet, at which
a party of dignified philosophers quarrelled over their viands
at a marriage feast, and came to blows. The style is a good
imitation of Plato, and the scene reminds one of the &ldquo;clients&rsquo;
dinner&rdquo; in the fifth satire of Juvenal. Matters come to a climax
by the attempt of one of the guests, Zenothemis, to secure for
himself a fatter fowl which had been served to his next neighbour
Hermon. Each seizes his bird and hits the other with it in the
face, at the same time pulling his beard. Then a general fight
ensues. The story is a satire on philosophy, the favourite topic
of a writer who believed neither in gods nor in men.</p>

<p>The <i>Piscator</i> (&ldquo;Fisherman&rdquo;), a dialogue between Lucian,
Socrates, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Plato and others, commences
with a general attack on the author as the enemy of philosophy.
Socrates proposes that the culprit should be tried, and that
Philosophia should assist in the prosecution. Lucian declares
that he does not know where such a person lives, long as he has
been looking for her (11). She is found at last, but declares
Lucian has never disparaged her, but only impostors and pretenders
under her name (15). He makes a long defence (pp. 598-606),
abusing the philosophers in the sort of language in which
some schools of theologians abuse the monks of the middle ages
(34). The trial is held in the Acropolis of Athens, and the sham
philosophers, dreading a verdict against them, throw themselves
from the rock. A Cynic flings away his scrip in the hurry, and on
examination it is found to contain, not books or loaves of bread,
but gold coins, dice and fragrant essences (44). At the end Lucian
baits his hook with a fig and a gold coin, and catches gluttonous
strollers in the city while seated on the wall of the Acropolis.</p>

<p>The <i>Voyage Home</i> (<span class="grk" title="Kataplous">&#922;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span>) opens with the complaint that
Charon&rsquo;s boat is kept waiting for Hermes, who soon appears
with his troop of ghosts. Among them is a <span class="grk" title="tyrannos">&#964;&#973;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, one Megapenthes,
who, as his name is intended to express, mourns greatly
over the life he has just left. Amusing appeals are made by other
souls for leave to return to life, and even bribes are offered to the
presiding goddess of destiny, but Clotho is inexorable. The
moral of the piece is closely like that of the parable of Dives and
Lazarus: the rich and prosperous bewail their fate, while the
poor and afflicted find rest from their troubles, and have no desire
to return to them. The <span class="grk" title="tyrannos">&#964;&#973;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> here is the man clothed in
purple and fine linen, and Lucian shows the same bitter dislike
of tyrants which Plato and the tragic writers display. The heavy
penalty is adjudged to Megapenthes that he may ever remember
in the other world the misdeeds done in life.</p>

<p>The <i>Sales of Lives</i> is an auction held by Zeus to see what price
the lives of philosophers of the rival sects will bring. A Pythagorean,
who speaks in the Ionic dialect, first undergoes an
examination as to what he can teach, and this contains an
enumeration of the doctrines usually ascribed to that sect,
including metempsychosis. He is valued at 7s. 6d., and is succeeded
by Diogenes, who avows himself the champion of truth,
a cosmopolitan (8), and the enemy of pleasure. Socrates brings
two talents, and is purchased by Dion, tyrant of Syracuse (19).
Chrysippus, who gives some specimens of his clever quibbles,<a name="fa7aa" id="fa7aa" href="#ft7aa"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
is bought for fifty pounds, Aristotle for nearly a hundred, while
Pyrrho the sceptic (or one of his school), who professes to &ldquo;know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
nothing,&rdquo; brings four pounds, &ldquo;<i>because</i> he is dull and stupid and
has no more sense than a grub&rdquo; (27). But the man raises a doubt,
&ldquo;whether or not he has really been bought,&rdquo; and refuses to go
with the purchaser till he has fully considered the matter.</p>

<p><i>Timon</i> is a very amusing and witty dialogue. The misanthrope,
once wealthy, has become a poor farm-labourer, and reproaches
Zeus for his indifference to the injustice of man. Zeus declares
that the noisy disputes in Attica have so disgusted him that he
has not been there for a long time (9). He tells Hermes to conduct
Plutus to visit Timon, and see what can be done to help
him. Plutus, who at first refuses to go, is persuaded after a
long conversation with Hermes, and Timon is found by them
digging in his field (31). Poverty is unwilling to resign her
votary to wealth; and Timon himself is with difficulty persuaded
to turn up with his mattock a crock of gold coins. Now
that he has once more become rich, his former flatterers come
cringing with their congratulations and respects, but they are
all driven off with broken heads or pelted with stones. Between
this dialogue and the <i>Plutus</i> of Aristophanes there are many
close resemblances.</p>

<p><i>Hermotimus</i> (pp. 739-831) is one of the longer dialogues,
Hermotimus, a student of the Stoic philosophy for twenty years
(2), and Lucian (Lycinus) being the interlocutors. The long
time&mdash;forty years at the least&mdash;required for climbing up to the
temple of virtue and happiness, and the short span of life, if any,
left for the enjoyment of it, are discussed. That the greatest
philosophers do not always attain perfect indifference, the Stoic
<i>ultimatum</i>, is shown by the anecdote of one who dragged his pupil
into court to make him pay his fee (9), and again by a violent
quarrel with another at a banquet (11). Virtue is compared to a
city with just and good and contented inhabitants; but so
many offer themselves as guides to the right road to virtue that
the inquirer is bewildered (26). What is truth, and who are the
right teachers of it? The question is argued at length, and
illustrated by a peculiar custom of watching the pairs of athletes
and setting aside the reserved combatant (<span class="grk" title="paredros">&#960;&#940;&#961;&#949;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>) at the
Olympian games by the marks on the ballots (40-43). This, it
is argued, cannot be done till all the ballots have been examined;
so a man cannot select the right way till he has tried all the ways
to virtue. But to know the doctrines of all the sects is impossible
in the term of a life (49). To take a taste of each, like trying a
sample of wine, will not do, because the doctrines taught are not,
like the crock of wine, the same throughout, but vary or advance
day by day (59). A suggestion is made (68) that the searcher
after truth should begin by taking lessons in the science of
discrimination, so as to be a good judge of truth before testing
the rival claims. But who is a good teacher of such a science?
(70). The general conclusion is that philosophy is not worth the
pursuit. &ldquo;If I ever again,&rdquo; says Hermotimus, &ldquo;meet a philosopher
on the road, I will shun him, as I would a mad dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Anacharsis</i> is a dialogue between Solon and the Scythian
philosopher, who has come to Athens to learn the nature of the
Greek institutions. Seeing the young men performing athletic
exercises in the Lyceum, he expresses his surprise at such a waste
of energy. This gives Socrates an opportunity of descanting at
length on training as a discipline, and emulation as a motive for
excelling. Love of glory, Solon says, is one of the chief goods in
life. The argument is rather ingenious and well put; the style
reminds us of the minor essays of Xenophon.</p>

<p>The <i>Alexander</i> or <i>False Prophet</i> is the subject of a separate
article (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alexander the Paphlagonian</a></span>).</p>

<p>These are the chief of Lucian&rsquo;s works. Many others, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Prometheus</i>, <i>Menippus</i>, <i>Life of Demonax</i>, <i>Toxaris</i>, <i>Zeus Tragoedus</i>,
<i>The Dream or the Cock</i>, <i>Icaromenippus</i> (an amusing

<p><span class="bold">LUCIFER<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> (d. 370/1), bishop of Cagliari (hence called <i>Caralitanus</i>),
an ardent supporter of the cause of Athanasius. After
the unfavourable result of the synod of Arles in 353 he volunteered
to endeavour to obtain a new and impartial council. He was
accordingly sent by Pope Liberius, with Pancratius the presbyter
and Hilarius the deacon, but could not prevent the condemnation
of Athanasius, which was renewed at Milan in 355. For his own
persistent adherence to the orthodox creed he was banished to
Germanicia in Commagene; he afterwards lived at Eleutheropolis
in Palestine, and finally in the upper Thebaid. His exile
came to an end with the publication of Julian&rsquo;s edict in 362.
From 363 until his death in 371 he lived at Cagliari in a state of
voluntary separation from ecclesiastical fellowship with his
former friends Eusebius of Vercelli, Athanasius and the rest, on
account of their mild decision at the synod of Alexandria in
362 with reference to the treatment of those who had unwillingly
Arianized under the persecutions of Constantius. Lucifer was
hardly sufficiently educated to appreciate the real question at
issue, and the sect which he thus founded did not continue
long after his death. It is doubtful whether it ever formulated
any distinctive doctrine; certainly it developed none of any
importance. The memory of Lucifer is still cherished in Sardinia;
but, although popularly regarded there as a saint, he has never
been canonized.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The controversial writings of Lucifer, dating from his exile, are
chiefly remarkable for their passionate zeal, and for the boldness and
violence of the language addressed to the reigning emperor, whom
he did not scruple to call the enemy of God and a second Saul,
Ahab and Jeroboam. Their titles, in the most probable chronological
order, are <i>De non parcendis in Deum delinquentibus</i>, <i>De
regibus apostaticis</i>, <i>Ad Constantium Augustum pro Athanasio libri
ii.</i>, <i>De non conveniendo cum haereticis and Moriendum esse pro
Filio Dei</i>. Their quotations of Scripture are of considerable value to
the critical student of the Latin text before Jerome. They were
first collected and edited by Tilius (Paris, 1568); the best edition
is that of W. Hartel in the Vienna <i>Corpus, Script. Eccl. Lat.</i> (1886).

the name given to the &ldquo;morning star,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the planet
Venus when it appears above the E. horizon before sunrise,
and sometimes also to the &ldquo;evening star,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the same planet in
the W. sky after sundown, more usually called Hesperus (<i>q.v.</i>).
The term &ldquo;day star&rdquo; (so rendered in the Revised Version)
was used poetically by Isaiah for the king of Babylon: &ldquo;How
art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the
nations&rdquo; (Is. xiv. 12, Authorized Version). The words ascribed
to Christ in Luke x. 18: &ldquo;I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
heaven&rdquo; (cf. Rev. ix. 1), were interpreted by the Christian
Fathers as referring to the passage in Isaiah; whence, in
Christian theology, Lucifer came to be regarded as the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
Satan before his fall. This idea finds its most magnificent
literary expression in Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i>. In this sense the
name is most commonly associated with the familiar phrase
&ldquo;as proud as Lucifer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCILIUS, GAIUS<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 180-103 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the earliest Roman
satirist, of whose writings only fragments remain, was born
at Suessa Aurunca in Campania. The dates assigned by Jerome
for his birth and death are 148 and 103 or 102 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> But it is
impossible to reconcile the first of these dates with other facts
recorded of him, and the date given by Jerome must be due to an
error, the true date being about 180 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> We learn from Velleius
Paterculus that he served under Scipio at the siege of Numantia
in 134. We learn from Horace that he lived on the most intimate
terms of friendship with Scipio and Laelius, and that he celebrated
the exploits and virtues of the former in his satires.
Fragments of those books of his satires which seem to have been
first given to the world (books xxvi.-xxix.) clearly indicate that
they were written in the lifetime of Scipio. Some of these bring
the poet before us as either corresponding with, or engaged in
controversial conversation with, his great friend. One line&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f90">Percrepa pugnam Popilli, facta Corneli cane&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">in which the defeat of M. Popillius Laenas, in 138, is contrasted
with the subsequent success of Scipio, bears the stamp of having
been written while the news of the capture of Numantia was still
fresh. It is in the highest degree improbable that Lucilius
served in the army at the age of fourteen; it is still more unlikely
that he could have been admitted into the familiar intimacy
of Scipio and Laelius at that age. It seems a moral impossibility
that between the age of fifteen and nineteen&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> between 133
and 129, the year of Scipio&rsquo;s death&mdash;he could have come before
the world as the author of an entirely new kind of composition,
and one which, to be at all successful, demands especially
maturity of judgment and experience. It may further be said
that the well-known words of Horace (<i>Satires</i>, ii. 1, 33), in which
he characterizes the vivid portraiture of his life, character and
thoughts, which Lucilius bequeathed to the world,</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem f90"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
                    <p class="i8">quo fit ut omnis</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">lose much of their force unless <i>senis</i> is to be taken in its ordinary
sense&mdash;which it cannot be if Lucilius died at the age of forty-six.
He spent the greater part of his life at Rome, and died, according
to Jerome, at Naples. Lucilius belonged to the equestrian order,
a fact indicated by Horace&rsquo;s notice of himself as &ldquo;infra Lucili
censum.&rdquo; Though not himself belonging to any of the great
senatorial families, he was in a position to associate with them
on equal terms. This circumstance contributed to the boldness,
originality and thoroughly national character of his literary
work. Had he been a &ldquo;semi-Graecus,&rdquo; like Ennius and Pacuvius,
or of humble origin, like Plautus, Terence or Accius, he would
scarcely have ventured, at a time when the senatorial power
was strongly in the ascendant, to revive the rôle which had
proved disastrous to Naevius; nor would he have had the
intimate knowledge of the political and social life of his day
which fitted him to be its painter. Another circumstance determining
the bent of his mind was the character of the time.
The origin of Roman political and social satire is to be traced
to the same disturbing and disorganizing forces which led to
the revolutionary projects and legislation of the Gracchi.</p>

<p>The reputation which Lucilius enjoyed in the best ages of
Roman literature is proved by the terms in which Cicero and
Horace speak of him. Persius, Juvenal and Quintilian vouch
for the admiration with which he was regarded in the first century
of the empire. The popularity which he enjoyed in his own
time is attested by the fact that at his death, although he had
filled none of the offices of state, he received the honour of a public
funeral. His chief claim to distinction is his literary originality.
He may be called the inventor of poetical satire, as he was the
first to impress upon the rude inartistic medley, known to the
Romans by the name of <i>satura</i>, that character of aggressive
and censorious criticism of persons, morals, manners, politics,
literature, &amp;c. which the word satire has ever since denoted.
In point of form the satire of Lucilius owed nothing to the Greeks.
It was a legitimate development of an indigenous dramatic entertainment,
popular among the Romans before the first introduction
of the forms of Greek art among them; and it seems largely
also to have employed the form of the familiar epistle. But the
style, substance and spirit of his writings were apparently as
original as the form. He seems to have commenced his poetical
career by ridiculing and parodying the conventional language
of epic and tragic poetry, and to have used the language commonly
employed in the social intercourse of educated men.
Even his frequent use of Greek words, phrases and quotations,
reprehended by Horace, was probably taken from the actual
practice of men, who found their own speech as yet inadequate
to give free expression to the new ideas and impressions which
they derived from their first contact with Greek philosophy,
rhetoric and poetry. Further, he not only created a style of his
own, but, instead of taking the substance of his writings from
Greek poetry, or from a remote past, he treated of the familiar
matters of daily life, of the politics, the wars, the administration
of justice, the eating and drinking, the money-making and
money-spending, the scandals and vices, which made up the
public and private life of Rome in the last quarter of the 2nd
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> This he did in a singularly frank, independent
and courageous spirit, with no private ambition to serve, or
party cause to advance, but with an honest desire to expose
the iniquity or incompetence of the governing body, the sordid
aims of the middle class, and the corruption and venality of the
city mob. There was nothing of stoical austerity or of rhetorical
indignation in the tone in which he treated the vices and follies
of his time. His character and tastes were much more akin
to those of Horace than of either Persius or Juvenal. But he
was what Horace was not, a thoroughly good hater; and he
lived at a time when the utmost freedom of speech and the most
unrestrained indulgence of public and private animosity were
the characteristics of men who took a prominent part in affairs.
Although Lucilius took no active part in the public life of his
time, he regarded it in the spirit of a man of the world and of
society, as well as a man of letters. His ideal of public virtue
and private worth had been formed by intimate association
with the greatest and best of the soldiers and statesmen of an
older generation.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The remains of Lucilius extend to about eleven hundred, mostly unconnected
lines, most of them preserved by late grammarians, as
illustrative of peculiar verbal usages. He was, for his time, a
voluminous as well as a very discursive writer. He left behind him
thirty books of satires, and there is reason to believe that each book,
like the books of Horace and Juvenal, was composed of different
pieces. The order in which they were known to the grammarians was
not that in which they were written. The earliest in order of composition
were probably those numbered from xxvi. to xxix., which
were written in the trochaic and iambic metres that had been employed
by Ennius and Pacuvius in their <i>Saturae</i>. In these he made
those criticisms on the older tragic and epic poets of which Horace
and other ancient writers speak. In them too he speaks of the
Numantine War as recently finished, and of Scipio as still living.
Book i., on the other hand, in which the philosopher Carneades, who
died in 128, is spoken of as dead, must have been written after the
death of Scipio. Most of the satires of Lucilius were written in hexameters,
but, so far as an opinion can be formed from a number of
unconnected fragments, he seems to have written the trochaic
tetrameter with a smoothness, clearness and simplicity which he
never attained in handling the hexameter. The longer fragments
produce the impression of great discursiveness and carelessness, but
at the same time of considerable force. He appears, in the composition
of his various pieces, to have treated everything that
occurred to him in the most desultory fashion, sometimes adopting
the form of dialogue, sometimes that of an epistle or an imaginary
discourse, and often to have spoken in his own name, giving an
account of his travels and adventures, or of amusing scenes that he
had witnessed, or expressing the results of his private meditations
and experiences. Like Horace he largely illustrated his own observations
by personal anecdotes and fables. The fragments clearly
show how often Horace has imitated him, not only in expression, but
in the form of his satires (see for instance i. 5 and ii. 2), in the topics
which he treats of, and the class of social vices and the types of
character which he satirizes. For students of Latin literature, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
chief interest of studying the fragments of Lucilius consists in the
light which they throw on the aims and methods of Horace in the
composition of his satires, and, though not to the same extent, of
his epistles. They are important also as materials for linguistic
study; and they have considerable historical value.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCILIUS JUNIOR,<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> a friend and correspondent of the younger
Seneca, probably the author of <i>Aetna</i>, a poem on the origin
of volcanic activity, variously attributed to Virgil, Cornelius
Severus (epic poet of the Augustan age) and Manilius. Its
composition has been placed as far back as 44 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, on the ground
that certain works of art, known to have been removed to Rome
about that date, are referred to as being at a distance from the
city. But as the author appears to have known and made use
of the <i>Quaestiones Naturales</i> of Seneca (written <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 65), and no
mention is made of the great eruption of Vesuvius (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 79), the
time of its composition seems to lie between these two dates.
In favour of the authorship of Lucilius are the facts that he was
a friend of Seneca and acquainted with his writings; that he
had for some time held the office of imperial procurator of Sicily,
and was thus familiar with the locality; that he was the author
of a poem on Sicilian subjects. It is objected that in the 79th
letter of Seneca, which is the chief authority on the question,
he apparently asks that Lucilius should introduce the hackneyed
theme of Aetna merely as an episode in his contemplated poem,
not make it the subject of separate treatment. The sources of
the Aetna are Posidonius of Apamea, and perhaps the pseudo-Aristotelian
<i>De Mundo</i>, while there are many reminiscences of
Lucretius. It has come down in a very corrupt state, and its
difficulties are increased by the unpoetical nature of the subject,
the straining after conciseness, and the obtrusive use of metaphor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCK,<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> a term for good or bad fortune, the unforeseen or

particularly used of the result of chances in games of skill

happiness, good fortune. The <i>New English Dictionary</i> considers
the word to have been introduced from the Low Countries as a

connected with the German <i>gelingen</i>, to succeed (cf. <i>Druck</i>,
pressure, from <i>dringen</i>), or with <i>locken</i>, to entice.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÜCKE, GOTTFRIED CHRISTIAN FRIEDRICH<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> (1791-1855),
German theologian, was born on the 24th of August 1791, at
Egeln near Magdeburg, where his father was a merchant. He
studied theology at Halle and Göttingen. In 1813 he became
<i>repetent</i> at Göttingen, and in 1814 he received the degree of
doctor in philosophy from Halle; in 1816 he removed to Berlin,
where he became licentiate in theology, and qualified as <i>privat-docent</i>.
He soon became intimate with Schleiermacher and de
Wette, and was associated with them in 1819 in the redaction
of the <i>Theologische Zeitschrift</i>. Meanwhile his lectures and
publications (among the latter a <i>Grundriss der Neutestamentlichen
Hermeneutik</i>, 1816) had brought him into considerable
repute, and he was appointed professor extraordinarius in the
new university of Bonn in the spring of 1818; in the following
autumn he became professor ordinarius. From Bonn, where
he had J. C. W. Augusti (1772-1841), J. K. L. Gieseler, and
Karl Immanuel Nitzsch for colleagues, he was called in 1827
to Göttingen to succeed K. F. Stäudlin (1761-1826). In that
year he helped to found the <i>Theologische Studien und Kritiken</i>,
the chief organ of the &ldquo;mediation&rdquo; theology (<i>Vermittelungstheologie</i>).
At Göttingen he remained, declining all further
calls elsewhere, as to Erlangen, Kiel, Halle, Tübingen, Jena
and Leipzig, until his death, which occurred on the 4th of
February 1855.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lücke, who was one of the most learned, many-sided and influential
of the so-called &ldquo;mediation&rdquo; school of evangelical theologians

has since passed through two new and improved editions (the last
volume of the 3rd edition by E. Bertheau, 1856). He is an intelligent

in connexion with this thesis he was one of the first to argue for the
early date and non-apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse. His
<i>Einleitung in die Offenbarung Johannis</i> was published in 1832 (2nd

<p><span class="bold">LUCKENWALDE,<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> a town in the Prussian province of Brandenburg,
on the Nuthe, 30 m. S. of Berlin, on the main line to
Dresden and Leipzig. Pop. (1905) 22,263. Its cloth and wool
manufactories are among the most extensive in Prussia. Among
its other industries are cotton printing and dye works, brewing,
and the making of metal and bronze goods.</p>

<p>The site of Luckenwalde was occupied in the 12th century
by a Cistercian monastery, but the village did not spring up till
the reign of Frederick the Great. It was made a town in 1808.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCKNOW,<a name="ar192" id="ar192"></a></span> a city, district and division of British India.
The city was the capital of Oudh from 1775 until it was merged
in the United Provinces in 1901. Pop. (1901) 264,049. It lies
mainly on the right bank of the winding river Gumti, which is
crossed by two railway and three road bridges. It contains
the Canning college (1864), with an Oriental department, and
La Martinière college, where about 100 boys are educated, the
institution being in part supported by an endowment left by
General Claude Martin in 1800. There are native manufactures
of gold and silver brocade, muslins, embroidery, brass and
copper wares, pottery and moulding in clay. There are also
important European industrial establishments, such as iron-works
and paper-mills. Lucknow is the centre of the Oudh and
Rohilkhand railway system, with large workshops. Lines
radiate to Cawnpore, Bareilly, Gonda, Fyzabad and Rae Bareli.
Lucknow is the headquarters of the 8th division of the northern
army. The cantonments are situated 3 m. E. of the city.</p>

<p>Lucknow is chiefly notable in the history of British India
as the capital of the nawabs who had dealings with Warren
Hastings, and their successors the kings of Oudh, whose deposition
by Lord Dalhousie was one of the chief causes of the Mutiny.
Amongst the events of the Mutiny the defence of the residency
of Lucknow comes only second in historic interest to the massacre
at Cawnpore itself. For the two sieges, see Indian Mutiny.
The name of the residency is now applied not only to the residency
itself, but to the whole of the outbuildings and entrenchments
in which Sir Henry Lawrence concentrated his small
force. These entrenchments covered almost 60 acres of ground,
and consisted of a number of detached houses, public edifices,
outhouses and casual buildings, netted together, and welded by
ditches, parapets, stockades and batteries into one connected
whole. On the summit of the plateau stands the residency
proper, the official residence of the chief commissioner, a lofty
building three storeys high, with a fine portico. Near the
residency comes the banqueting hall, and beyond the Baillie
Guardgate lie the ruins of the surgeon&rsquo;s house, where Sir Henry
Lawrence died of a shell-wound, and where the ladies of the
garrison were sheltered in underground rooms. Round the
line of the entrenchments are pillars marked with the name of
the various &ldquo;posts&rdquo; into which the garrison was distributed.
The most dangerous of these was the Cawnpore battery post,
where the stockade was directly exposed to the enemy&rsquo;s fire.
The mutineers had rifles fixed in rests in the house opposite,
and swept the road that led through the residency enclosure
at this point. Close to the residency is the Lawrence Memorial,
an artificial mound 30 ft. high crowned by a marble cross.</p>

<p>Among the other buildings of interest in Lucknow is the
Imambara, which is one of the largest rooms in the world (162 ft.
by 54), having an arched roof without supports. This room was
built by the Nawab Asaf-ud-dowlah in 1784, to afford relief to
the famine-stricken people. The many monuments of his
reign include his country palace of Bibiapur, outside the city.
Among later bulldings are the two palaces of Chhattar Manzil,
erected for the wives of Ghazi-ud-din Haidar (1814), the remains
of the Farhat Baksh, dating from the previous reign, and adjoining
the greater Chhattar Manzil, the observatory (now a
bank) of Nasir-ud-din Haidar (1827), the imambara or mausoleum
and the unfinished great mosque (Jama Masjid) of Mahommed
Ali Shah (1837), and the huge debased Kaisar Bagh, the palace
of Wajid Ali Shah (1847-1856).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <span class="sc">District of Lucknow</span> lies on both sides of the river Gumti,
and has an area of 967 sq. m. Its general aspect is that of an open
champaign, well studded with villages, finely wooded and in parts
most fertile and highly cultivated. In the vicinity of rivers, however,
stretch extensive barren sandy tracts (<i>bhúr</i>), and there are many
wastes of saline efflorescence (<i>usár</i>). The country is an almost dead
level, the average slope, which is from N.W. to S.E., being less than
a foot per mile. The principal rivers are the Gumti and the Sai
with their tributaries. The population in 1901 was 793,241, showing
an increase of 2.5% in the preceding decade.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Division of Lucknow</span> contains the western half of the old
province of Oudh. It comprises the six districts of Lucknow, Unao,
Sitapur, Rae Bareli, Hardoi and Kheri. Its area is 12,051 sq. m.
and its population in 1901 was 5,977,086, showing an increase of
2.06% in the decade.</p>

Vendée, 23 m. S.E. of La Roche-sur-Yon, on the railway from
Nantes to Bordeaux, and on the canal of Luçon (9 m. long), which
affords communication with the sea in the Bay of Aiguillon.
Pop. (1906) 6163. Between Luçon and the sea stretch marshy
plains, the bed of the former gulf, partly drained by numerous
canals, and in the reclaimed parts yielding excellent pasturage,
while in other parts are productive salt-marshes, and ponds for
the rearing of mussels and other shell-fish. Luçon is the seat
of a bishopric, established in 1317, and held by Richelieu from
1607 to 1624. The cathedral, partly of the 12th-century and
partly of later periods, was originally an abbey church. The
façade and the clock tower date from about 1700, and the tower
is surmounted by a crocketed spire rising 275 ft. above the
ground, attributed to the architect François Leduc of Tuscany.
The cloisters are of the late 15th century. Adjacent is the
bishop&rsquo;s palace, possessing a large theological library and
Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Disciples of Emmaus,&rdquo; and there is a fine public
garden. A communal college and an ecclesiastical seminary are
among the public institutions. During the Vendean wars,
Luçon was the scene of several conflicts, notably in 1793.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCRETIUS<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Titus Lucretius Carus</span>) (<i>c.</i> 98-55 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the
great Latin didactic poet. Our sole information concerning his
life is found in the brief summary of Jerome, written more than
four centuries after the poet&rsquo;s death. Jerome followed, often
carelessly, the accounts contained in the lost work of Suetonius
<i>De Viris Illustribus</i>, written about two centuries after the death
of Lucretius; and, although it is likely that Suetonius used the
information transmitted by earlier grammarians, there is nothing
to guide us to the original sources. According to this account
the poet was born in 95 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; he became mad in consequence of
the administration of a love-philtre; and after composing
several books in his lucid intervals, which were subsequently
corrected by Cicero, he died by his own hand in the forty-fourth
year of his age. Donatus states in his life of Virgil, a work also
based on the lost work of Suetonius, that Lucretius died on the
same day on which Virgil assumed the <i>toga virilis</i>, that is, in the
seventeenth year of Virgil&rsquo;s life, and on the very day on which
he was born, and adds that the consuls were the same, that is
Cn. Pompeius Magnus and M. Licinius Crassus, consuls in 70
and again in 55. The statements cannot be perfectly reconciled;
but we may say with certainty that Lucretius was born between
98 and 95 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and died in 55 or 54. A single mention of his
poem, the <i>De rerum natura</i> (which from the condition in which
it has reached us may be assumed to have been published
posthumously) in a letter of Cicero&rsquo;s to his brother Quintus,
written early in 54 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, confirms the date given by Donatus
as that of the poet&rsquo;s death. The statements of Jerome have
been questioned or disbelieved on the ground of their intrinsic
improbability. They have been regarded as a fiction invented
later by the enemies of Epicureanism, with the view of discrediting
the most powerful work ever produced by any disciple of
that sect. It is more in conformity with ancient credulity than
with modern science to attribute a permanent tendency to
derangement to the accidental administration of any drug,
however potent. A work characterized by such strength,
consistency and continuity of thought is not likely to have been
composed &ldquo;in the intervals of madness&rdquo; as Jerome says.
Donatus, in mentioning the poet&rsquo;s death, gives no hint of the
act of suicide. The poets of the Augustan age, who were deeply
interested both in his philosophy and in his poetry, are entirely
silent about the tragical story of his life. Cicero, by his professed
antagonism to the doctrines of Epicurus, by his inadequate
appreciation of Lucretius himself and by the indifference
which he shows to other contemporary poets, seems to have been
neither fitted for the task of correcting the unfinished work of
a writer whose genius was so distinct from his own, nor likely to
have cordially undertaken such a task.</p>

<p>Yet these considerations do not lead to the absolute rejection
of the story. The evidence afforded by the poem rather leads
to the conclusion that the tradition contains some germ of fact.
It is remarkable that in more than one passage of his poem
Lucretius writes with extraordinary vividness of the impression
produced both by dreams and by waking visions. It is true
that the philosophy of Epicurus put great stress on these, as
affording the explanation of the origin of supernatural beliefs.
But the insistence with which Lucretius returns to the subject,
and the horror with which he recalls the effects of such abnormal
phenomena, suggest that he himself may have been liable to
such hallucinations, which are said to be consistent with perfect
sanity, though they may be the precursors either of madness
or of a state of despair and melancholy. Other passages, where
he describes himself as ever engaged, even in his dreams, on his
task of inquiry and composition, produce the impression of an
unrelieved strain of mind and feeling, which may have ended in
some extreme reaction of spirit, or in some failure of intellectual
power, that may have led him to commit suicide. But the
strongest confirmation of the tradition is the unfinished condition
in which the poem has reached us. The subject appears indeed
to have been fully treated in accordance with the plan sketched
out in the introduction to the first book. But that book is the
only one which is finished in style and in the arrangement of
its matter. In all the others, and especially in the last three,
the continuity of the argument is frequently broken by passages
which must have been inserted after the first draft of the arguments
was written out. Thus, for instance, in his account of
the transition from savage to civilized life, he assumes at
v. 1011 the discovery of the use of skins, fire, &amp;c., and the first
beginning of civil society, and proceeds at 1028 to explain the
origin of language, and then again returns, from 1090 to 1160,
to speculate upon the first use of fire and the earliest stages of
political life. These breaks in continuity show what might also
be inferred from frequent repetitions of lines which have appeared
earlier in the poem, and from the rough workmanship of passages
in the later books, that the poem could not have received the
final revision of the author. Nor is there any great difficulty
in believing that Cicero edited it; the word &ldquo;emendavit,&rdquo;
need not mean more than what we call &ldquo;preparing for
press.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the absence of any claim on the part of any other district
of Italy to the honour of having given birth to Lucretius it is
inferred that he was of purely Roman origin. No writer certainly
is more purely Roman in personal character and in strength of
understanding. His silence on the subject of Roman greatness
and glory as contrasted with the prominence of these subjects
in the poetry of men of provincial birth such as Ennius, Virgil
and Horace, may be explained by the principle that familiarity
had made the subject one of less wonder and novelty to him.
The Lucretian gens to which he belonged was one of the oldest
of the great Roman houses, nor do we hear of the name, as we
do of other great family names, as being diffused over other
parts of Italy, or as designating men of obscure or servile
origin. It may well be assumed that Lucretius was a member of
the Roman aristocracy, belonging either to a senatorian or to
one of the great equestrian families. If the Roman aristocracy
of his time had lost much of the virtue and of the governing
qualities of their ancestors, they showed in the last years before
the establishment of monarchy a taste for intellectual culture
which might have made Rome as great in literature as in arms
and law. A new taste for philosophy had developed among
members of the governing class during the youth of Lucretius,
and eminent Greek teachers of the Epicurean sect settled at
Rome at the same time, and lived on terms of intimacy with
them. The inference that Lucretius belonged to this class
is confirmed by the tone in which he addresses Gaius Memmius,
a man of an eminent senatorian family, to whom the poem is
dedicated. His tone is quite unlike that in which Virgil or even
Horace addresses Maecenas. He addresses him as an equal;
he expresses sympathy with the prominent part he played in
public life, and admiration for his varied accomplishments,
but on his own subject claims to speak to him with authority.</p>

<p>Although our conception of the poet&rsquo;s life is necessarily vague
and meagre, yet his personal force is so remarkable and so vividly
impressed on his poem, that we seem able to form a consistent
idea of his qualities and characteristics. We know, for example,
that the choice of a contemplative life was not the result of
indifference to the fate of the world, or of any natural coldness
or even calmness of temperament. In the opening lines of the
second and third books we can mark the recoil of a humane
and sensitive spirit from the horrors of the reign of terror which
he witnessed in his youth, and from the anarchy and confusion
which prevailed at Rome during his later years. We may also
infer that he had not been through his whole career so much
estranged from the social life of his day as he seems to have been
in his later years. Passages in his poem attest his familiarity
with the pomp and luxury of city life, with the attractions of
the public games and with the pageantry of great military
spectacles. But much the greater mass of the illustrations of
his philosophy indicate that, while engaged on his poem he must
have passed much of his time in the open air, exercising at once
the keen observation of a naturalist and the contemplative vision
of a poet. He seems to have found a pleasure, more congenial
to the modern than to the ancient temperament, in ascending
mountains or wandering among their solitudes (vi. 469, iv.
575). References to companionship in these wanderings, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
the well-known description of the charm of a rustic meal
(ii. 29) speak of kindly sociality rather than of any austere
separation from his fellows.</p>

<p>Other expressions in his poem (<i>e.g.</i> iii. 10, &amp;c.) imply that
he was also a student of books. Foremost among these were
the writings of Epicurus; but he had also an intimate knowledge
of the philosophical poem of Empedocles, and at least
an acquaintance with the works of Democritus, Anaxagoras,
Heraclitus, Plato and the Stoical writers. Of other Greek prose
writers he knew Thucydides and Hippocrates; while of the
poets he expresses in more than one passage the highest admiration
of Homer, whom he imitated in several places. Next to
Homer Euripides is most frequently reproduced by him. But
his poetical sympathy was not limited to the poets of Greece.
For his own countryman Ennius he expresses an affectionate
admiration; and he imitates his language, his rhythm and his
manner in many places. The fragments of the old tragedian
Pacuvius and of the satirist Lucilius show that Lucretius had
made use of their expressions and materials. In his studies he
was attracted by the older writers, both Greek and Roman, in
whose masculine temperament and understanding he recognized
an affinity with his own.</p>

<p>His devotion to Epicurus seems at first sight more difficult
to explain than his enthusiasm for Empedocles or Ennius.
Probably he found in his calmness of temperament, even in his
want of imagination, a sense of rest and of exemption from the
disturbing influences of life; while in his physical philosophy
he found both an answer to the questions which perplexed him
and an inexhaustible stimulus to his intellectual curiosity. The
combative energy, the sense of superiority, the spirit of satire,
characteristic of him as a Roman, unite with his loyalty to
Epicurus to render him not only polemical but intolerant and
contemptuous in his tone toward the great antagonists of his
system, the Stoics, whom, while constantly referring to them,
he does not condescend even to name. With his admiration of
the genius of others he combines a strong sense of his own power.
He is quite conscious of the great importance and of the difficulty
of his task; but he feels his own ability to cope with it.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to infer the moral than the intellectual
characteristics of a great writer from the personal impress left
by him on his work. Yet it is not too much to say that there is no
work in any literature that produces a profounder impression of
sincerity. No writer shows a juster scorn of all mere rhetoric
and exaggeration. No one shows truer courage, not marred by
irreverence, in confronting the great problems of human destiny,
or greater strength in triumphing over human weakness. No one
shows a truer humanity and a more tender sympathy with
natural sorrow.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the poem of Lucretius, that which makes it
unique in literature, is that it is a reasoned system of philosophy,
written in verse. The prosaic title <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, a translation
of the Gr. <span class="grk" title="peri physeôs">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>, implies the subordination of the
artistic to a speculative motive. As in the case of nearly all the
great works of Roman literary genius, the form of the poem was
borrowed from the Greeks. The rise of speculative philosophy
in Greece was coincident with the beginning of prose composition,
and many of the earliest philosophers wrote in the prose of the
Ionic dialect; others, however, and especially the writers of the
Greek colonies in Italy and Sicily, expounded their systems in
continuous poems composed in the epic hexameter. Most famous
in connexion with this kind of poetry are Xenophanes and
Parmenides, the Eleatics and Empedocles of Agrigentum. The
last was less important as a philosopher, but greater than the
others both as a poet and a physicist. On both of these grounds
he had a greater attraction to Lucretius. The fragments of the
poem of Empedocles show that the Roman poet regarded that
work as his model. In accordance with this model he has given
to his own poem the form of a personal address, he has developed
his argument systematically, and has applied the sustained
impetus of epic poetry to the treatment of some of the driest and
abstrusest topics. Many ideas and expressions of the Sicilian
have been reproduced by the Roman poet; and the same tone of
impassioned solemnity and melancholy seems to have pervaded
both works. But Lucretius, if less original as a thinker, was
probably a much greater poet than Empedocles. What chiefly
distinguishes him from his Greek prototypes is that his purpose
is rather ethical than purely speculative; the zeal of a teacher
and reformer is more strong in him than even the intellectual
passion of a thinker. His speculative ideas, his moral teaching
and his poetical power are indeed interdependent on one another,
and this interdependence is what mainly constitutes their
power and interest. But of the three claims which he makes to
immortality, the importance of his subject, his desire to liberate
the mind from the bonds of superstition and the charm and
lucidity of his poetry&mdash;that which he himself regarded as supreme
was the second. The main idea of the poem is the irreconcilable
opposition between the truth of the laws of nature and the
falsehood of the old superstitions. But, further, the happiness
and the dignity of life are regarded by him as absolutely
dependent on the acceptance of the true and the rejection of the
false doctrine. In the Epicurean system of philosophy he
believed that he had found the weapons by which this war of
liberation could be most effectually waged. Following Epicurus
he sets before himself the aim of finally crushing that fear of the
gods and that fear of death resulting from it which he regards as
the source of all the human ills. Incidentally he desires also
to purify the heart from other violent passions which corrupt it
and mar its peace. But the source even of these&mdash;the passions of
ambition and avarice&mdash;he finds in the fear of death; and that
fear he resolves into the fear of eternal punishment after death.</p>

<p>The selection of his subject and the order in which it is treated
are determined by this motive. Although the title of the poem
implies that it is a treatise on the &ldquo;whole nature of things,&rdquo;
the aim of Lucretius is to treat only those branches of science
which are necessary to clear the mind from the fear of the gods
and the terrors of a future state. In the two earliest books,
accordingly, he lays down and largely illustrates the first principles
of being with the view of showing that the world is not
governed by capricious agency, but has come into existence,
continues in existence, and will ultimately pass away in accordance
with the primary conditions of the elemental atoms which,
along with empty space, are the only eternal and immutable
substances. These atoms are themselves infinite in number but
limited in their varieties, and by their ceaseless movement and
combinations during infinite time and through infinite space
the whole process of creation is maintained. In the third book
he applies the principles of the atomic philosophy to explain the
nature of the mind and vital principle, with the view of showing
that the soul perishes with the body. In the fourth book he
discusses the Epicurean doctrine of the images, which are cast
from all bodies, and which act either on the senses or immediately
on the mind, in dreams or waking visions, as affording the explanation
of the belief in the continued existence of the spirits
of the departed. The fifth book, which has the most general
interest, professes to explain the process by which the earth, the
sea, the sky, the sun, moon and stars, were formed, the origin
of life, and the gradual advance of man from the most savage to
the most civilized condition. All these topics are treated with
the view of showing that the world is not itself divine nor directed
by divine agency. The sixth book is devoted to the explanation,
in accordance with natural causes, of some of the more abnormal
phenomena, such as thunderstorms, volcanoes, earthquakes, &amp;c.,
which are special causes of supernatural terrors.</p>

<p>The consecutive study of the argument produces on most
readers a mixed feeling of dissatisfaction and admiration. They
are repelled by the dryness of much of the matter, the unsuitableness
of many of the topics discussed for poetic treatment, the
arbitrary assumption of premises, the entire failure to establish
the connexion between the concrete phenomena which the
author professes to explain and these assumptions, and the
erroneousness of many of the doctrines which are stated with
dogmatic confidence. On the other hand, they are constantly
impressed by his power of reasoning both deductively and
inductively, by the subtlety and fertility of invention with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
he applies analogies, by the clearness and keenness of his observation,
by the fulness of matter with which his mind is stored, and
by the consecutive force, the precision and distinctness of his
style, when employed in the processes of scientific exposition.
The first two books enable us better than anything else in ancient
literature to appreciate the boldness and, on the whole, the
reasonableness of the ancient mind in forming hypotheses on
great matters that still occupy the investigations of physical
science. The third and fourth books give evidence of acuteness
in psychological analysis; the fourth and sixth of the most
active and varied observation of natural phenomena; the fifth
of original insight and strong common sense in conceiving the
origin of society and the progressive advance of man to civilization.
But the chief value of Lucretius as a thinker lies in his
firm grasp of speculative ideas, and in his application of them to
the interpretation of human life and nature. All phenomena,
moral as well as material, are contemplated by him in their
relation to one great organic whole, which he acknowledges
under the name of &ldquo;Natura daedala rerum,&rdquo; and the most
beneficent manifestations of which he seems to symbolize and
almost to deify in the &ldquo;Alma Venus,&rdquo; whom, in apparent contradiction
to his denial of a divine interference with human
affairs, he invokes with prayer in the opening lines of the poem.
In this conception of nature are united the conceptions of law and
order, of ever-changing life and interdependence, of immensity,
individuality, and all-pervading subtlety, under which the
universe is apprehended both by his intelligence and his imagination.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more unlike the religious and moral attitude
of Lucretius than the old popular conception of him as an
atheist and a preacher of the doctrine of pleasure. It is true that
he denies the doctrines of a supernatural government of the
world and of a future life. But his arguments against the first
are really only valid against the limited and unworthy conceptions
of divine agency involved in the ancient religions; his
denial of the second is prompted by his vital realization of all
that is meant by the arbitrary infliction of eternal torment after
death. His war with the popular beliefs of his time is waged, not
in the interests of licence, but in vindication of the sanctity of
human feeling. The cardinal line of the poem,</p>

<p class="center f90">
&ldquo;Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">is elicited from him as his protest against the sacrifice of Iphigenia
by her father. But in his very denial of a cruel, limited and
capricious agency of the gods, and in his imaginative recognition
of an orderly, all-pervading, all-regulating power, we find at
least a nearer approach to the higher conceptions of modern
theism than in any of the other imaginative conceptions of
ancient poetry and art. But his conception even of the ancient
gods and of their indirect influence on human life is more worthy
than the popular one. He conceives of them as living a life of
eternal peace and exemption from passion, in a world of their
own; and the highest ideal of man is, through the exercise of his
reason, to realize an image of this life. Although they are
conceived of as unconcerned with the interest of our world,
yet influences are supposed to emanate from them which the
human heart is capable of receiving and assimilating. The effect
of unworthy conceptions of the divine nature is that they render
a man incapable of visiting the temples of the gods in a calm
spirit, or of receiving the emanations that &ldquo;announce the
divine peace&rdquo; in peaceful tranquillity. The supposed &ldquo;atheism&rdquo;
of Lucretius proceeds from a more deeply reverential spirit than
that of the majority of professed believers in all times.</p>

<p>His moral attitude is also far removed from that of ordinary
ancient Epicureanism or of modern materialism. Though he
acknowledges pleasure to be the law of life, yet he is far from
regarding its attainment as the end of life. What man needs is
not enjoyment, but &ldquo;peace and a pure heart.&rdquo; The victory
to be won by man is the triumph over fear, ambition, passion,
luxury. With the conquest over these nature herself supplies
all that is needed for happiness. Self-control and renunciation
are the lessons which he preaches.</p>

<p>It has been doubted whether Cicero,<a name="fa1ac" id="fa1ac" href="#ft1ac"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in his short criticism in
the letter already referred to, concedes to Lucretius both the
gifts of genius and the accomplishment of art or only one of
them. Readers of a later time, who could compare his work with
the finished works of the Augustan age, would certainly disparage
his art rather than his power. But with Cicero it was different. He
greatly admired, or professed to admire, the genius of the early
Roman poets, while he shows indifference to the poetical genius
of his younger contemporaries. Yet he could not have been
insensible to the immense superiority in rhythmical smoothness
which the hexameter of Lucretius has over that of Ennius and
Lucilius. And no reader of Lucretius can doubt that he attached
the greatest importance to artistic execution, and that he took
a great pleasure, not only in &ldquo;the long roll of his hexameter,&rdquo;
but also in producing the effects of alliteration, assonance,
&amp;c., which are so marked a peculiarity in the style of Plautus and
the earlier Roman poets. He allows his taste for these tricks
of style to degenerate into mannerism. And this is the only
drawback to the impression of absolute spontaneity which his
style produces. He was unfortunate in living before the natural
rudeness of Latin art had been successfully grappled with.
His only important precursors in serious poetry were Ennius and
Lucilius, and, though he derived from the first of these an
impulse to shape the Latin tongue into a fitting vehicle for the
expression of elevated emotion and imaginative conception, he
could find in neither a guide to follow in the task he set before
himself. The difficulty and novelty of his task enhances our
sense of his power. His finest passages are thus characterized
by a freshness of feeling and enthusiasm of discovery. But the
result of these conditions and of his own inadequate conception
of the proper limits of his art is that his best poetry is clogged
with a great mass of alien matter, which no treatment in the
world could have made poetically endurable.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCULLUS,<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> the name of a Roman plebeian family of the
Licinian <i>gens</i>. By far the most famous of its members was
<span class="sc">Lucius Licinius Lucullus</span> (<i>c.</i> 110-56), surnamed Ponticus from
his victories in Asia Minor over Mithradates VI. of Pontus.
His father, of the same name, had held an important military
command in Sicily, but on his return to Rome he was prosecuted
on a charge of bribery and condemned to exile. His mother was
Caecilia, of the family of the Metelli, and sister of Quintus
Caecilius Metellus Numidicus. Early in life he attached himself
to the party of Sulla, and to that party he remained constant.
He attracted Sulla&rsquo;s notice in the Social War (90) and in 88,
when Sulla was appointed to the command of the war against
Mithradates, accompanied him as quaestor to Greece and Asia
Minor. While Sulla was besieging Athens, Lucullus raised a
fleet and drove Mithradates out of the Mediterranean. He won
a brilliant victory off Tenedos, and had he been more of a patriot
and less of a party man he might have ended a perilous war.
In 84 peace was concluded with Mithradates. Sulla returned
to Rome, while Lucullus remained in Asia, and by wise and
generous financial reforms laid the foundation of the prosperity
of the province. The result of his policy was that he became
extremely popular with the provincials, but offended many of
the <i>publicani</i>, a powerful class which farmed the public revenue.
In 80 he returned to Rome as curule aedile, in which capacity
he exhibited games of exceptional magnificence. Soon afterwards
(77) he was elected praetor, and was next appointed to
the province of Africa, where he again won a good name as a
just and considerate governor. In 74 he became consul, and
went to Asia at the head of about 30,000 foot and 2000 horse,
to defend the province of Bithynia against Mithradates, who
was besieging his colleague, Marcus Aurelius Cotta, in Chalcedon
on the Propontis. Mithradates was forced to retire along the
sea-coast till he halted before the strong city of Cyzicus, which
he besieged. Lucullus, however, cut off his communications on
the land side, and, aided by bad weather, forced him to raise
the siege. In the autumn of 73 Lucullus marched to Cabeira
or Neocaesarea, where the king had gone into winter quarters
with a vague hope that his son-in-law, Tigranes, king of Armenia,
and possibly even the Parthians, might come to his aid. Although
the forces of Mithradates were far superior in numbers,
his troops were no match for the Roman legionaries. A large
detachment of his army having been cut up by one of Lucullus&rsquo;s
lieutenant-generals, the king decided on instant retreat. The
retreat soon became a disorderly flight, Mithradates himself
escaping with difficulty into Lesser Armenia.</p>

<p>Thus Pontus, with the exception of some of the maritime
cities, such as Sinope, Heraclea and Amisus, became Roman
territory. Two years were occupied in the capture of these
strongholds, while Lucullus busied himself with a general reform
of the administration of the province of Asia. His next step
was to demand the surrender of Mithradates and to threaten
Tigranes with war in the event of refusal. In the spring of 69,
at the head of only two legions, he marched through Sophene,
the south-western portion of Armenia, crossed the Tigris, and
pushed on to the newly-built royal city, Tigranocerta, situated
on one of the affluents of that river. A motley host, made up out
of the tribes bordering on the Black Sea and the Caspian, hovered
round his small army, but failed to hinder him from laying siege
to the town. Lucullus showed consummate military capacity,
contriving to maintain the siege and at the same time to give
battle to the enemy&rsquo;s vastly superior forces. There might now
have been peace but for the interference of Mithradates, who
pressed Tigranes to renew the war and to seek the aid and
alliance of Parthia. The Parthian king, however, preferred a
treaty with Rome to a treaty with Armenia, and desired simply
to have the Euphrates recognized as his western boundary.
Mithradates next appealed to the national spirit of the peoples
of the East generally, and endeavoured to rouse them to a united
effort. The position of Lucullus was critical. The home government
was for recalling him, and his army was disaffected.
Nevertheless, though continually harassed by the enemy, he
persisted in marching northwards from Tigranocerta over the
high table-land of central Armenia, in the hope of reaching
Artaxata on the Araxes. But the open mutiny of his troops
compelled him to recross the Tigris into the Mesopotamian
valley. Here, on a dark tempestuous night, he surprised and
stormed Nisibis, the capital of the Armenian district of Mesopotamia,
and in this city, which yielded him a rich booty, he
found satisfactory winter quarters. Meantime Mithradates was
again in Pontus, and in a disastrous engagement at Ziela the
Roman camp was taken and the army slaughtered to a man.
Lucullus was obliged to retreat into Asia Minor, leaving Tigranes
and Mithradates masters of Pontus and Cappadocia. The work
of eight years of war was undone. In 66 Lucullus was superseded
by Pompey. He had fairly earned the honour of a triumph, but
his powerful enemies at Rome and charges of maladministration,
to which his immense wealth gave colour, caused it to be deferred
till 63. From this time, with the exception of occasional public
appearances, he gave himself up to elegant luxury, with which
he combined a sort of dilettante pursuit of philosophy, literature
and art. As a general he does not seem to have possessed the
entire confidence of his troops, owing probably to his natural
hauteur and the strict discipline which he imposed on them.
The same causes made him unpopular with the Roman capitalists,
whose sole object was the accumulation of enormous fortunes
by farming the revenue of the provinces.</p>

<p>Among the Roman nobles who revelled in the newly acquired
riches of the East, Lucullus stood pre-eminent. His park and
pleasure grounds near Rome, and the costly and laborious works
in his parks and villas at Tusculum, near Naples, earned for him
from Pompey (it is said) the title of the &ldquo;Roman Xerxes.&rdquo; On
one of his luxurious entertainments he is said to have spent
upwards of £2000. He was a liberal patron of Greek philosophers
and men of letters, and he collected a valuable library, to which
such men had free access. He himself is said to have been a
student of Greek literature, and to have written a history of the
Marsian war in Greek, inserting solecisms to show that he was a
Roman. He was one of the interlocutors in Cicero&rsquo;s <i>Academica</i>,
the second book (first edition) of which was called <i>Lucullus</i>.
Sulla also entrusted him with the revision of his <i>Memoirs</i>. The
introduction of the cherry-tree from Asia into Europe is attributed
to him. It appears that he became mentally feeble some
years before his death, and was obliged to surrender the management
of his affairs to his brother Marcus. The usual funeral
panegyric was pronounced on him in the Forum, and the people
would have had him buried by the side of Sulla in the Campus
Martius, but at his brother&rsquo;s request he was laid in his splendid
villa at Tusculum.</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Marcus Licinius Lucullus</span>, was adopted by
Marcus Terentius Varro, and was hence known as Marcus
Terentius Varro Lucullus. In 82 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he served under Sulla
against Marius. In 79 he was curule aedile with his brother,
in 77 praetor, in 73 consul with Gaius Cassius Varus. When
praetor he forbade the carrying of arms by slaves, and with his
colleague in the consulship passed the <i>lex Terentia Cassia</i>, to
give authority for purchasing corn with the public money and
retailing it at a fixed price at Rome. As proconsul in Macedonia
he made war with great cruelty against the Dardani and Bessi,
and compelled them to acknowledge the supremacy of Rome.

Having enjoyed a triumph, he was sent out to the East to settle
the affairs of the provinces conquered by his brother. He sided
with Cicero during the Catilinarian conspiracy, did his utmost
to prevent his banishment, and subsequently supported his
claim for the restoration of his house. He was one of the better
representatives of the optimates, and enjoyed some reputation
as an orator.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUCY, SIR THOMAS<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> (1532-1600), the English Warwickshire
squire who is traditionally associated with the youth of William
Shakespeare, was born on the 24th of April 1532, the son of
William Lucy, and was descended, according to Dugdale, from
Thurstane de Cherlecote, whose son Walter received the village
of Charlecote from Henry de Montfort about 1190. Walter is
said to have married into the Anglo-Norman family of Lucy,
and his son adopted the mother&rsquo;s surname. Three of Sir Thomas
Lucy&rsquo;s ancestors had been sheriffs of Warwickshire and Leicestershire,
and on his father&rsquo;s death in 1552 he inherited Sherborne
and Hampton Lucy in addition to Charlecote, which was rebuilt
for him by John of Padua, known as John Thorpe, about 1558.
By his marriage with Joyce Acton he inherited Sutton Park
in Worcestershire, and became in 1586 high sheriff of the county.
He was knighted in 1565. He is said to have been under the
tutorship of John Foxe, who is supposed to have imbued his
pupil with the Puritan principles which he displayed as knight
of the shire for Warwick in the parliament of 1571 and as sheriff
of the county, but as Mrs Carmichael Stopes points out Foxe
only left Oxford in 1545, and in 1547 went up to London, so
that the connexion must have been short. He often appeared
at Stratford-on-Avon as justice of the peace and as commissioner
of musters for the county. As justice of the peace he showed
great zeal against the Catholics, and took his share in the arrest
of Edward Arden in 1583. In 1585 he introduced into parliament
a bill for the better preservation of game and grain, and
his reputation as a preserver of game gives some colour to the
Shakespearian tradition connected with his name. Nicholas
Rowe, writing in 1710, told a story that Lucy prosecuted Shakespeare
for deer-stealing from Charlecote Park in 1585, and that
Shakespeare aggravated the offence by writing a ballad on his
prosecutor. The trouble arising from this incident is said to have
driven Shakespeare from Stratford to London. The tale was
corroborated by Archdeacon Davies of Sapperton, Gloucestershire,
who died in 1708. The story is not necessarily falsified
by the fact that there was no deer park at Charlecote at the
time, since there was a warren, and the term warren legally covers
a preserve for other animals than hares or rabbits, roe-deer
among others. Shakespeare is generally supposed to have
caricatured the local magnate of Stratford in his portrait of
Justice Shallow, who made his first appearance in the second
part of <i>Henry IV.</i>, and a second in the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>.
Robert Shallow is a justice of the peace in the county of Gloucester
and his ancestors have the dozen white luces in their
coats, the arms of the Lucys being three luces, while in Dugdale&rsquo;s
<i>Warwickshire</i> (ed. 1656) there is drawn a coat-of-arms in
which these are repeated in each of the four quarters, making
twelve in all. There are many considerations which make it
unlikely that Shallow represents Lucy, the chief being the noteworthy
difference in their circumstances. Lucy died at Charlecote
on the 7th of July 1600. His grandson, Sir Thomas Lucy
(1585-1640), was a friend of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and was
eulogized by John Davies of Hereford in 1610. The Charlecote
estates eventually passed to the Rev. John Hammond through
his marriage with Alice Lucy, and in 1789 he adopted the name
of Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUDDITES,<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> the name given to organized bands of English
rioters for the destruction of machinery, who made their first
appearance in Nottingham and the neighbouring districts towards
the end of 1811. The origin of the name is given
in Pellew&rsquo;s <i>Life of Lord Sidmouth</i> (iii. 80). In 1779 there
lived in a village in Leicestershire a person of weak intellect,
called Ned Ludd, who was the butt of the boys of the village.
On one occasion Ludd pursued one of his tormentors into a
house where were two of the frames used in stocking manufacture,
and, not being able to catch the boy, vented his anger on
the frames. Afterwards, whenever any frames were broken, it
became a common saying that Ludd had done it. The riots
arose out of the severe distress caused by the war with France.
The leader of the riotous bands took the name of &ldquo;General
Ludd.&rdquo; The riots were specially directed against machinery
because of the widespread prejudice that its use produced a
scarcity in the demand for labour. Apart from this prejudice,
it was inevitable that the economic and social revolution implied
in the change from manual labour to work by machinery should
give rise to great misery. The riots began with the destruction
of stocking and lace frames, and, continuing through the winter
and the following spring, spread into Yorkshire, Lancashire,
Derbyshire and Leicestershire. They were met by severe
repressive legislation, introduced by Lord Liverpool&rsquo;s government,
a notable feature in the opposition to which was Lord
Byron&rsquo;s speech in the House of Lords. In 1816 the rioting was
resumed, caused by the depression which followed the peace of
1815 and aggravated by one of the worst of recorded harvests.
In that year, although the centre of the rioting was again in
Nottingham, it extended over almost the whole kingdom. The
rioters were also thoroughly organized. While part of the band
destroyed the machinery, sentinels were posted to give warning
of the approach of the military. Vigorous repressive measures,
and, especially, reviving prosperity, brought the movement
to an end.</p>

Jullundur division of the Punjab. The town is 8 m. from the
present left bank of the Sutlej, 228 m. by rail N.W. of Delhi.
Pop. (1901) 48,649. It is an important centre of trade in grain,
and has manufactures of shawls, &amp;c., by Kashmiri weavers, and
of scarves, turbans, furniture and carriages. There is an American
Presbyterian mission, which maintains a medical school for
Christian women, founded in 1894.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Ludhiana</span> lies south of the river Sutlej, and
north of the native states of Patiala, Jind, Nabha and Maler
Kotla. Area 1455 sq. m. The district consists for the most
part of a broad plain, without hills or rivers, stretching northward
from the native borders to the ancient bed of the Sutlej.
The soil is a rich clay, broken by large patches of shifting sand.
On the eastern edge, towards Umballa, the clay is covered by
a bed of rich mould, suitable for the cultivation of cotton and
sugar-cane. Towards the west the sand occurs in union with the
superficial clay, and forms a light friable soil, on which cereals
form the most profitable crop. Even here, however, the earth is
so retentive of moisture that good harvests are reaped from
fields which appear mere stretches of dry and sandy waste.
These southern uplands descend to the valley of the Sutlej by
an abrupt terrace, which marks the former bed of the river.
The principal stream has shifted to the opposite side of the
valley, leaving an alluvial strip, 10 m. in width, between its
ancient and its modern bed. The Sutlej itself is here only
navigable for boats of small burden. A branch of the Sirhind
canal irrigates a large part of the western area. The population
in 1901 was 673,097. The principal crops are wheat, millets,
pulse, maize and sugar-cane. The district is crossed by the main
line of the North-Western railway from Delhi to Lahore, with
two branches.</p>

<p>During the Mussulman epoch, the history of the district is
bound up with that of the Rais of Raikot, a family of converted
Rajputs, who received the country as a fief under the Sayyid
dynasty, about 1445. The town of Ludhiana was founded in
1480 by two of the Lodi race (then ruling at Delhi), from whom
it derives its name, and was built in great part from the prehistoric
bricks of Sunet. The Lodis continued in possession until
1620, when it again fell into the hands of the Rais of Raikot.
Throughout the palmy days of the Mogul empire the Raikot
family held sway, but the Sikhs took advantage of the troubled
period which accompanied the Mogul decadence to establish
their supremacy south of the Sutlej. Several of their chieftains
made encroachments on the domains of the Rais, who were only
able to hold their own by the aid of George Thomas, the famous
adventurer of Hariana. In 1806 Ranjit Singh crossed the Sutlej
and reduced the obstinate Mahommedan family, and distributed
their territory amongst his co-religionists. Since the British
occupation of the Punjab, Ludhiana has grown in wealth and
population.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUDLOW, EDMUND<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1617-1692), English parliamentarian,
son of Sir Henry Ludlow of Maiden Bradley, Wiltshire, whose
family had been established in that county since the 15th century,
was born in 1617 or 1618. He went to Trinity College, Oxford,
and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1638. When the Great
Rebellion broke out, he engaged as a volunteer in the life guard
of Lord Essex. His first essay in arms was at Worcester, his next
at Edgehill. He was made governor of Wardour Castle in 1643,
but had to surrender after a tenacious defence on the 18th of
March 1644. On being exchanged soon afterwards, he engaged
as major of Sir A. Hesilrige&rsquo;s regiment of horse. He was present
at the second battle of Newbury, October 1644, at the siege of
Basing House in November, and took part in an expedition to
relieve Taunton in December. In January his regiment was
surprised by Sir M. Langdale, Ludlow himself escaping with
difficulty. In 1646 he was elected M.P. for Wilts in the room of
his father and attached himself to the republican party. He
opposed the negotiations with the king, and was one of the chief
promoters of Pride&rsquo;s Purge in 1648. He was one of the king&rsquo;s
judges, and signed the warrant for his execution. In February
he was elected a member of the council of state. In January
1651 Ludlow was sent into Ireland as lieutenant-general of horse,
holding also a civil commission. Here he spared neither health
nor money in the public service. Ireton, the deputy of Ireland,
died on the 26th of November 1651; Ludlow then held the chief
command, and had practically completed the conquest of the
island when he resigned his authority to Fleetwood in October
1652. Though disapproving Cromwell&rsquo;s action in dissolving the
Long Parliament, he maintained his employment, but when
Cromwell was declared Protector he declined to acknowledge
his authority. On returning to England in October 1655 he was
arrested, and on refusing to submit to the government was
allowed to retire to Essex. After Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s death
Ludlow was returned for Hindon in Richard&rsquo;s parliament of
1659, but opposed the continuance of the protectorate. He sat
in the restored Rump, and was a member of its council of state
and of the committee of safety after its second expulsion, and a
commissioner for the nomination of officers in the army. In July
he was sent to Ireland as commander-in-chief. Returning in
October 1659, he endeavoured to support the failing republican
cause by reconciling the army to the parliament. In December
he returned hastily to Ireland to suppress a movement in favour
of the Long Parliament, but on arrival found himself almost
without supporters. He came back to England in January 1660,
and was met by an impeachment presented against him to
the restored parliament. His influence and authority had now
disappeared, and all chance of regaining them vanished with
Lambert&rsquo;s failure. He took his seat in the Convention parliament
as member for Hindon, but his election was annulled on the
18th of May. Ludlow was not excepted from the Act of Indemnity,
but was included among the fifty-two for whom punishment
less than capital was reserved. Accordingly, on the
proclamation of the king ordering the regicides to come in,
Ludlow emerged from his concealment, and on the 20th of June
surrendered to the Speaker; but finding that his life was not
assured, he succeeded in escaping to Dieppe, travelled to Geneva
and Lausanne, and thence to Vevey, then under the protection
of the canton of Bern. There he remained, and in spite of plots
to assassinate him he was unmolested by the government of
that canton, which had also extended its protection to other
regicides. He steadily refused during thirty years of exile to
have anything to do with the desperate enterprises of republican
plotters. But in 1689 he returned to England, hoping to be
employed in Irish affairs. He was however remembered only
as a regicide, and an address from the House of Commons was
presented to William III. by Sir Edward Seymour, requesting
the king to issue a proclamation for his arrest. Ludlow escaped
again, and returned to Vevey, where he died in 1692. A monument
raised to his memory by his widow is in the church of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
St Martin. Over the door of the house in which he lived was
placed the inscription &ldquo;Omne solum forti patria, quia Patris.&rdquo;
Ludlow married Elizabeth, daughter of William Thomas, of
Wenvoe, Glamorganshire, but left no issue.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His <i>Memoirs</i>, extending to the year 1672, were published in 1698-1699
at Vevey and have been often reprinted; a new edition, with
notes and illustrative material and introductory memoir, was issued
by C. H. Firth in 1894. They are strongly partisan, but the picture
of the times is lifelike and realistic. Ludlow also published &ldquo;a
letter from Sir Hardress Waller ... to Lieutenant-General Ludlow
with his answer&rdquo; (1660), in defence of his conduct in Ireland. See

<p><span class="bold">LUDLOW,<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in the Ludlow
parliamentary division of Shropshire, England, on the Hereford-Shrewsbury
joint line of the Great Western and London &amp;
North Western railways, 162 m. W.N.W. from London. Pop.
(1901) 4552. It is beautifully situated at the junction of the
rivers Teme and Corve, upon and about a wooded eminence
crowned by a massive ruined castle. Parts of this castle date
from the 11th century, but there are many additions such as
the late Norman circular chapel, the Decorated state rooms,
and details in Perpendicular and Tudor styles. The parish
church of St Lawrence is a cruciform Perpendicular building,
with a lofty central tower, and a noteworthy east window,
its 15th-century glass showing the martyrdom of St Lawrence.
There are many fine half-timbered houses of the 17th century,
and one of seven old town-gates remains. The grammar school,
founded in the reign of John, was incorporated by Edward I.
The principal public buildings are the guildhall, town-hall
and market-house, and public rooms, which include a museum
of natural history. Tanning and flour-milling are carried on.
The town is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors.
Area 416 acres.</p>

<p>The country neighbouring Ludlow is richly wooded and hilly,
while the scenery of the Teme is exquisite. Westward, Vinnal
Hill reaches 1235 ft., eastward lies Titterstone Clee (1749 ft.).
Richard&rsquo;s Castle, 3 m. S. on the borders of Herefordshire, dates
from the reign of Edward the Confessor, but little more than
its great artificial mound remains. At Bromfield, 3 m. above
Ludlow on the Teme, the church and some remains of domestic
buildings belonged to a Benedictine monastery of the 12th
century.</p>

<p>Ludlow is supposed to have existed under the name of Dinan
in the time of the Britons. Eyton in his history of Shropshire
identifies it with one of the &ldquo;Ludes&rdquo; mentioned in the Domesday
Survey, which was held by Roger de Lacy of Osbern FitzRichard
and supposes that Roger built the castle soon after 1086, while
a chronicle of the FitzWarren family attributes the castle to
Roger earl of Shrewsbury. The manor afterwards belonged to
the Lacys, and in the beginning of the 14th century passed by
marriage to Roger de Mortimer and through him to Edward IV.
Ludlow was a borough by prescription in the 13th century,
but the burgesses owe most of their privileges to their allegiance
to the house of York. Richard, duke of York, in 1450 confirmed
their government by 12 burgesses and 24 assistants, and Edward
IV. on his accession incorporated them under the title of bailiffs
and burgesses, granted them the town at a fee-farm of £24, 3s. 4d.,
a merchant gild and freedom from toll. Several confirmations
of this charter were granted; the last, dated 1665, continued
in force (with a short interval in the reign of James II.) until
the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. By the charter of
Edward IV. Ludlow returned 2 members to parliament, but in
1867 the number was reduced to one, and in 1885 the town
was disfranchised. The market rights are claimed by the corporation
under the charters of Edward IV. (1461) and Edward
VI. (1552). The court of the Marches was established at Ludlow
in the reign of Henry VII., and continued to be held here until
it was abolished in the reign of William III. Ludlow castle
was granted by Edward IV. to his two sons, and by Henry
VII. to Prince Arthur, who died here in 1502. In 1634 Milton&rsquo;s
Comus was performed in the castle under its original style of
&ldquo;A Masque presented at Ludlow Castle,&rdquo; before the earl of
Bridgewater, Lord President of Wales. The castle was garrisoned
in 1642 by Prince Rupert, who went there after the battle
of Naseby, but in 1646 it surrendered to Parliament and was
afterwards dismantled.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUDLOW GROUP,<a name="ar209" id="ar209"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Ludlovian</span>, in geology, the uppermost
subdivision of the Silurian rocks in Great Britain. This group
contains the following formations in descending order:&mdash;Tilestones,
Downton Castle sandstones (90 ft.), Ledbury shales
(270 ft.), Upper Ludlow rocks (140 ft.), Aymestry limestone
(up to 40 ft.), Lower Ludlow rocks (350 to 780 ft.). The Ludlow
group is essentially shaly in character, except towards the top,
where the beds become more sandy and pass gradually into the
base of the Old Red Sandstone. The Aymestry limestone,
which is irregular in thickness, is sometimes absent, and where
the underlying Wenlock limestones are absent the shales of the
Ludlow group graduate downwards into the Wenlock shales.
The group is typically developed between Ludlow and Aymestry,
and it occurs also in the detached Silurian areas between Dudley
and the mouth of the Severn.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Lower Ludlow rocks</i> are mainly grey, greenish and brown
mudstones and sandy and calcareous shales. They contain an
abundance of fossils. The series has been zoned by means of the
graptolites by E. M. R. Wood; the following in ascending order,
are the zonal forms: <i>Monograptus vulgaris</i>, <i>M. Nilssoni</i>, <i>M. scanicus</i>,
<i>M. tumescens</i> and <i>M. leintwardinensis</i>. <i>Cyathaspis ludensis</i>, the
earliest British vertebrate fossil, was found in these rocks at Leintwardine
in Shropshire, a noted fossil locality. Trilobites are numerous
(<i>Phacops caudatus</i>, <i>Lichas anglicus</i>, <i>Homolonotus delphinocephalus</i>,
<i>Calymene Blumenbachii</i>); brachiopods (<i>Leptaena rhomboidalis</i>,
<i>Rhynchonella Wilsoni</i>, <i>Atrypa reticularis</i>), pelecypods (<i>Cardiola
interrupta</i>, <i>Ctenodonta sulcata</i>) and gasteropods and cephalopods
(many species of <i>Orthoceras</i> and also <i>Gomphoceras</i>, <i>Trochoceras</i>) are
well represented. Other fossils are <i>Ceratiocaris</i>, <i>Pterygotus</i>, <i>Protaster</i>,
<i>Palaeocoma</i> and <i>Palaeodiscus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Upper Ludlow rocks</i> are mainly soft mudstones and shales with
some harder sandy beds capable of being worked as building-stones.
These sandy beds are often found covered with ripple-marks and
annelid tracks; one of the uppermost sandy layers is known as the
&ldquo;Fucoid bed&rdquo; from the abundance of the seaweed-like impressions
it bears. At the top of this sub-group, near Ludlow, a brown layer
occurs, from a quarter of an inch to 4 in. in thickness, full of the fragmentary
remains of fish associated with those of <i>Pterygotus</i> and mollusca.
This layer, known as the &ldquo;Ludlow Bone bed,&rdquo; has been
traced over a very large area (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bone Bed</a></span>). The common fossils
include plants (<i>Actinophyllum</i>, <i>Chondrites</i>), ostracods, phyllocarids,
eurypterids, trilobites (less common than in the older groups),
numerous brachiopods (<i>Lingula minima</i>, <i>Chonetes striatella</i>), gasteropods,
pelecypods and cephalopods (<i>Orthoceras bullatum</i>). Fish
include <i>Cephalaspis</i>, <i>Cyathaspis</i>, <i>Auchenaspis</i>. The Tilestones,
Downton Castle Sandstone and Ledbury shales are occasionally
grouped together under the term <i>Downtonian</i>. They are in reality
passage beds between the Silurian and Old Red Sandstone, and were
originally placed in the latter system by Sir R. I. Murchison. They
are mostly grey, yellow or red micaceous, shaly sandstones. <i>Lingula
cornea</i>, <i>Platyschisma helicites</i> and numerous phyllocarids and ostracods
occur among the fossils.</p>

<p>In Denbighshire and Merionethshire the upper portion of the
Denbighshire Grits belongs to this horizon: viz. those from
below upwards, the Nantglyn Flags, the Upper Grit beds, the <i>Monograptus
leintwardinensis</i> beds and the Dinas Bran beds. In the
Silurian area of the Lake district the Coldwell beds, forming the upper
part of the Coniston Flags, are the equivalents of the Lower Ludlow;
they are succeeded by the Coniston Grits (4000 ft.), the Bannisdale
Slates (5200 ft.) and the Kirkby Moor Flags (2000 ft.).</p>

<p>In the Silurian areas of southern Scotland, the Ludlow rocks are
represented in the Kirkcudbright Shore and Riccarton district by the
Raeberry Castle beds and Balmae Grits (500-750 ft.). In the northern
belt&mdash;Lanarkshire and the Pentland Hills&mdash;the lower portion (or
Ludlovian) consists of mudstones, flaggy shales and greywackes;
but the upper (or Downtonian) part is made up principally of thick
red and yellow sandstones and conglomerates with green mudstones.
The Ludlow rocks of Ireland include the &ldquo;Salrock beds&rdquo; of County
Galway and the &ldquo;Croagmarhin beds&rdquo; of Dingle promontory.</p>

was born at Erfurt on the 15th of June 1624. After
studying philology at the Erfurt academy and at Leiden, he
travelled in order to increase his linguistic knowledge. While
in Italy he became acquainted with one Gregorius, an Abyssinian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
scholar, and acquired from him an intimate knowledge of the
Ethiopian language. In 1652 he entered the service of the duke
of Saxe-Gotha, in which he continued until 1678, when he retired
to Frankfort-on-Main. In 1683 he visited England to promote
a cherished scheme for establishing trade with Abyssinia, but
his efforts were unsuccessful, chiefly through the bigotry of the
authorities of the Abyssinian Church. Returning to Frankfort
in 1684, he gave himself wholly to literary work, which he continued
almost to his death on the 8th of April 1704. In 1690
he was appointed president of the <i>collegium imperiale historicum</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The works of Ludolf, who is said to have been acquainted with
twenty-five languages, include <i>Sciagraphia historiae aethiopicae</i>
(Jena, 1676); and the <i>Historia aethiopica</i> (Frankfort, 1681), which
has been translated into English, French and Dutch, and which was
supplemented by a <i>Commentarius</i> (1691) and by <i>Appendices</i> (1693-1694).

<p><span class="bold">LUDWIG, KARL FRIEDRICH WILHELM<a name="ar211" id="ar211"></a></span> (1816-1895),
German physiologist, was born at Witzenhausen, near Cassel, on
the 29th of December 1816. He studied medicine at Erlangen
and Marburg, taking his doctor&rsquo;s degree at Marburg in 1839.
He made Marburg his home for the next ten years, studying
and teaching anatomy and physiology, first as prosector to
F. L. Fick (1841), then as <i>privat-docent</i> (1842), and finally as
extraordinary professor (1846). In 1849 he was chosen professor
of anatomy and physiology at Zürich, and six years afterwards
he went to Vienna as professor in the Josephinum (school for
military surgeons). In 1865 he was appointed to the newly
created chair of physiology at Leipzig, and continued there
until his death on the 23rd of April 1895. Ludwig&rsquo;s name is
prominent in the history of physiology, and he had a large share
in bringing about the change in the method of that science
which took place about the middle of the 19th century. With his
friends H. von Helmholtz, E. W. Brücke and E. Du Bois-Reymond,
whom he met for the first time in Berlin in 1847,
he rejected the assumption that the phenomena of living animals
depend on special biological laws and vital forces different from
those which operate in the domain of inorganic nature; and he
sought to explain them by reference to the same laws as are
applicable in the case of physical and chemical phenomena.
This point of view was expressed in his celebrated <i>Text-book
of Human Physiology</i> (1852-1856), but it is as evident in his
earliest paper (1842) on the process of urinary secretion as in
all his subsequent work. Ludwig exercised enormous influence
on the progress of physiology, not only by the discoveries he
made, but also by the new methods and apparatus he introduced
to its service. Thus in regard to secretion, he showed that
secretory glands, such as the submaxillary, are more than mere
filters, and that their secretory action is attended by chemical
and thermal changes both in themselves and in the blood passing
through them. He demonstrated the existence of a new class
of secretory nerves that control this action, and by showing
that if the nerves are appropriately stimulated the salivary glands
continue to secrete, even though the animal be decapitated, he
initiated the method of experimenting with excised organs.
He devised the kymograph as a means of obtaining a written
record of the variations in the pressure of the blood in the blood-vessels;
and this apparatus not only conducted him to many
important conclusions respecting the mechanics of the circulation,
but afforded the first instance of the use of the graphic method
in physiological inquiries. For the purpose of his researches
on the gases in the blood, he designed the mercurial blood-pump
which in various modifications has come into extensive use,
and by its aid he made many investigations on the gases of the
lymph, the gaseous interchanges in living muscle, the significance
of oxidized material in the blood, &amp;c. There is indeed scarcely
any branch of physiology, except the physiology of the senses,
to which he did not make important contributions. He was also
a great power as a teacher and the founder of a school. Under
him the Physiological Institute at Leipzig became an organized
centre of physiological research, whence issued a steady stream
of original work; and though the papers containing the results
usually bore the name of his pupils only, every investigation
was inspired by him and carried out under his personal direction.
Thus his pupils gained a practical acquaintance with his methods
and ways of thought, and, coming from all parts of Europe,
they returned to their own countries to spread and extend his
doctrines. Possessed himself of extraordinary manipulative
skill, he abhorred rough and clumsy work, and he insisted that
experiments on animals should be planned and prepared with
the utmost care, not only to avoid the infliction of pain (which
was also guarded against by the use of an anaesthetic), but to
ensure that the deductions drawn from them should have their
full scientific value.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUDWIG, OTTO<a name="ar212" id="ar212"></a></span> (1813-1865), German dramatist, novelist
and critic, was born at Eisfeld in Thuringia, on the 11th of
February 1813. His father, who was syndic of Eisfeld, died when
the boy was twelve years old, and he was brought up amidst
uncongenial conditions. He had devoted his leisure to poetry
and music, which unfitted him for the mercantile career planned
for him. The attention of the duke of Meiningen was directed
to one of his musical compositions, an opera, <i>Die Köhlerin</i>, and
Ludwig was enabled in 1839 to continue his musical studies under
Mendelssohn in Leipzig. But ill-health and constitutional
shyness caused him to give up a musical career, and he turned
exclusively to literary studies, and wrote several stories and
dramas. Of the latter, <i>Der Erbförster</i> (1850) attracted immediate
attention as a masterly psychological study. It was followed
by <i>Die Makkabäer</i> (1852), in which the realistic method of
<i>Der Erbförster</i> was transferred to an historical <i>milieu</i>, which
allowed more brilliant colouring and a freer play of the imagination.
With these tragedies, to which may be added <i>Die Rechte
des Herzens</i> and <i>Das Fräulein von Scuderi</i>, the comedy <i>Hans
Frey</i>, and an unfinished tragedy on the subject of Agnes
Bernauer, Ludwig ranks immediately after Hebbel as Germany&rsquo;s
most notable dramatic poet at the middle of the 19th century.
Meanwhile he had married and settled permanently in Dresden,
where he turned his attention to fiction. He published a
series of admirable stories of Thuringian life, characterized by
the same attention to minute detail and careful psychological
analysis as his dramas. The best of these are <i>Die Heiteretei
und ihr Widerspiel</i> (1851), and Ludwig&rsquo;s masterpiece, the powerful
novel, <i>Zwischen Himmel und Erde</i> (1855). In his <i>Shakespeare-Studien</i>
(not published until 1891) Ludwig showed himself a discriminating
critic, with a fine insight into the hidden springs of
the creative imagination. So great, however, was his enthusiasm
for Shakespeare, that he was led to depreciate Schiller in a way
which found little favour among his countrymen. He died at
Dresden on the 25th of February 1865.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUG,<a name="ar216" id="ar216"></a></span> a verb meaning to pull a heavy object, to drag, now
mainly used colloquially. It is probably Scandinavian in origin;
the Swedish <i>lugg</i>, forelock, lock of hair, gives <i>lugga</i>, to pull,
tug; and &ldquo;lug&rdquo; in some north-eastern English dialects is still
chiefly used in the sense of pulling a person&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Luggage,&rdquo;
passengers&rsquo; baggage, means by origin that which has to be
&ldquo;lugged&rdquo; about. The Scandinavian word may be also the
source of &ldquo;lug,&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;ear,&rdquo; in Scotland the regular
dialectical word, and in English commonly applied to the ear-shaped
handles of metal or earthenware pots, pitchers, &amp;c. If
so the word means something that can be pulled or tugged. This
is also possibly the origin of the &ldquo;lug&rdquo; or &ldquo;lug-sail,&rdquo; a four-sided
sail attached to a yard which is hung obliquely to the mast,
whence probably the name &ldquo;lugger&rdquo; of a sailing-vessel with
two or three masts and fore and aft lug-sails. The word may,
however, be connected with the Dutch <i>logger</i>, a fishing-boat
using drag-nets. &ldquo;Lug&rdquo; is also the name of a marine worm,
<i>Arenicola marina</i>, used as bait.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUGANO<a name="ar217" id="ar217"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Lauis</i>), the most populous and most thriving
town in the Swiss canton of Ticino or Tessin, situated (906 ft.)
on the northern shore of the lake of Lugano. Pop. (1900) 9394,
almost all Italian-speaking and Romanists. To the S. it
is dominated by the Monte Salvatore (3004 ft.) and on the
S.E. (across the lake) by the Monte Generoso (5591 ft.)&mdash;a
magnificent view point. Both mountains are accessible by
railways. By rail Lugano is 124 m. from Lucerne and 51½ m.
from Milan. Situated on the main St Gotthard railway line,
Lugano is now easily reached, so that it is much frequented
by visitors (largely German) in spring and in autumn. Though
politically Swiss since 1512, Lugano is thoroughly Italian in
appearance and character. Of recent years many improvements
have been made in the town, which has two important suburbs&mdash;Paradiso
to the south and Cassarate to the east. The railway
station (1109 ft.) is above the town, and is connected with the
fine quays by a funicular railway. On the main quay is a statue
of William Tell by the sculptor Vincenzo Vela (1820-1891),
a native of the town, while other works by him are in the gardens
of private villas in the neighbourhood. The principal church,
San Lorenzo, in part dates back earlier than the 15th century,
while its richly sculptured façade bears the figures 1517. This
church is now the cathedral church of the bishop of Lugano,
a see erected in 1888, with jurisdiction over the Italian parts
of Switzerland. The church of Santa Maria degli Angioli, built
about 1499, and till 1848 occupied by Franciscans, contains
several very fine frescoes (particularly a Crucifixion) painted 1529-1530
by Bernardino Luini. A gallery containing modern pictures
has been built on the site of the old palace of the bishops of Como.
During the struggle of 1848-1866 to expel the Austrians from
Lombardy, Lugano served as headquarters for Mazzini and his
followers. Books and tracts intended for distribution in Italy
were produced there and at Capolago (9 m. distant, at the S.E.
end of the lake), and the efforts of the Austrian police to prevent
their circulation were completely powerless.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUGANO, LAKE OF<a name="ar218" id="ar218"></a></span> (also called <span class="sc">Ceresio</span>), one of the smaller
lakes in Lombardy, N. Italy, lying between Lago Maggiore (W.)
and the Lake of Como (E). It is of very irregular shape, the
great promontory of Monte Salvatore (3004 ft.) nearly cutting
off the western arm from the main lake. The whole lake has an
area of 19½ sq. m., its greatest length is about 22 m., its greatest
width 2 m., and its greatest depth 945 ft., while its surface is
899 ft. above sea-level. Between Melide (S. of the town of
Lugano) and Maroggia (on the east shore) the lake is so shallow
that a great stone dam has been built across for the St Gotthard
railway line and the carriage road. The chief town is Lugano
(at its northern end), which by the St Gotthard line is 19 m. from
Bellinzona and 9 m. from Capolago, the station at the south-eastern
extremity of the lake, which is but 8 m. by rail from
Como. At the south-western extremity a railway leads S.W.
from Porto Ceresio to Varese (9 m.). Porlezza, at the east end
of the lake, is 8 m. by rail from Menaggio on the Lake of Como,
while Ponte Tresa, at the west end of the lake, is about the same
distance by a steam tramway from Luino on Lago Maggiore.
Of the total area of the lake, about 7½ sq. m. are in the Swiss
Canton of Ticino (Tessin), formed in 1803 out of the conquests
made by the Swiss from the Milanese in 1512. The remainder
of the area is in Italy. The lake lies among the outer spurs
of the Alps that divide the Ticino (Tessin) basin from that of
the Adda, where the calcareous strata have been disturbed by
the intrusion of porphyry and other igneous rocks. It is not
connected with any considerable valley, but is fed by numerous
torrents issuing from short glens in the surrounding mountains,
while it is drained by the Tresa, an unimportant stream flowing
into Lago Maggiore. The first steamer was placed on the lake
in 1856.</p>

southern Russia, in the government of Ekaterinoslav. Pop.
(1900) 34,175. It has a technical railway school and a meteorological
observatory, stands on the small river Lugan, 10 m. from
its confluence with the northern Donets, in the Lugan mining
district, 213 m. E. of the city of Ekaterinoslav, and has prospered
greatly since 1890. This district, which comprises the coal-mines
of Lisichansk and the anthracite mines of Gorodishche,
occupies about 110,000 acres on the banks of the Donets river.
Although it is mentioned in the 16th century, and coal was discovered
there at the time of Peter the Great, it was not until
1795 that an Englishman, Gascoyne or Gaskoin, established
its first iron-works for supplying the Black Sea fleet and the
southern fortresses with guns and shot. This proved a failure,
owing to the great distance from the sea; but during the Crimean
War the iron-works of Lugan again produced shot, shell and gun-carriages.
Since 1864 agricultural implements, steam-engines,

<p><span class="bold">LUGARD, SIR FREDERICK JOHN DEALTRY<a name="ar220" id="ar220"></a></span> (1858-&emsp;&emsp;),
British soldier, African explorer and administrator, son of the
Rev. F. G. Lugard, was born on the 22nd of January 1858. He
entered the army in 1878, joining the Norfolk regiment. He served
in the Afghan War of 1879-80, in the Sudan campaign of 1884-85,
and in Burma in 1886-87. In May 1888, while on temporary
half-pay, he took command of an expedition organized by the
British settlers in Nyasaland against the Arab slave traders
on Lake Nyasa, and was severely wounded. He left Nyasaland
in April 1889, and in the same year was engaged by the Imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
British East Africa Company. In their service he explored the
Sabaki river and the neighbouring region, and elaborated a scheme
for the emancipation of the slaves held by the Arabs in the
Zanzibar mainland. In 1890 he was sent by the company to
Uganda, where he secured British predominance and put an end
to the civil disturbances, though not without severe fighting,
chiefly notable for an unprovoked attack by the &ldquo;French&rdquo;
on the &ldquo;British&rdquo; faction. While administering Uganda he
journeyed round Ruwenzori to Albert Edward Nyanza, mapping
a large area of the country. He also visited Albert Nyanza, and
brought away some thousands of Sudanese who had been left
there by Emin Pasha and H. M. Stanley. In 1892 Lugard
returned to England, where he successfully opposed the abandonment
of Uganda by Great Britain, a step then contemplated
by the fourth Gladstone administration. In 1894 Lugard was
despatched by the Royal Niger Company to Borgu, where,
distancing his French and German rivals in a country up to then
unvisited by any Europeans, he secured treaties with the kings
and chiefs acknowledging the sovereignty of the British company.
In 1896-1897 he took charge of an expedition to Lake Ngami
on behalf of the British West Charterland Company. From
Ngami he was recalled by the British government and sent to
West Africa, where he was commissioned to raise a native
force to protect British interests in the hinterland of Lagos and
Nigeria against French aggression. In August 1897 he raised the
West African Frontier Force, and commanded it until the end
of December 1899. The differences with France were then composed,
and, the Royal Niger Company having surrendered its
charter, Lugard was chosen as high commissioner of Northern
Nigeria. The part of Northern Nigeria under effective control
was small, and Lugard&rsquo;s task in organizing this vast territory
was rendered more difficult by the refusal of the sultan of Sokoto
and many other Fula princes to fulfil their treaty obligations.
In 1903 a successful campaign against the emir of Kano and the
sultan of Sokoto rendered the extension of British control over
the whole protectorate possible, and when in September 1906
he resigned his commissionership, the whole country was being
peacefully administered under the supervision of British residents
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nigeria</a></span>). In April 1907 he was appointed governor of
Hong-Kong. Lugard was created a C.B. in 1895 and a K.C.M.G.
in 1901. He became a colonel in 1905, and held the local rank
of brigadier-general. He married in 1902 Flora Louise Shaw
(daughter of Major-General George Shaw, C.B., R.A.), who for
some years had been a distinguished writer on colonial subjects
for <i>The Times</i>. Sir Frederick (then Captain) Lugard published
in 1893 <i>The Rise of our East African Empire</i> (partly autobiographical),
and was the author of various valuable reports
on Northern Nigeria issued by the Colonial Office. Throughout
his African administrations Lugard sought strenuously to secure
the amelioration of the condition of the native races, among
other means by the exclusion, wherever possible, of alcoholic
liquors, and by the suppression of slave raiding and slavery.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUGO,<a name="ar221" id="ar221"></a></span> a maritime province of north-western Spain, formed in
1833 of districts taken from the old province of Galicia, and
bounded N. by the Atlantic, E. by Oviedo and Leon, S. by
Orense, and W. by Pontevedra and Corunna. Pop. (1900)
465,386; area, 3814 sq. m. The coast, which extends for about
40 m. from the estuary of Rivadéo to Cape de Vares, is extremely
rugged and inaccessible, and few of the inlets, except those of
Rivadéo and Vivero, admit large vessels. The province, especially
in the north and east, is mountainous, being traversed by the
Cantabrian chain and its offshoots; the sierra which separates
it from Leon attains in places a height of 6000 ft. A large part
of the area is drained by the Miño. This river, formed by the
meeting of many smaller streams in the northern half of the
province, follows a southerly direction until joined by the Sil,
which for a considerable distance forms the southern boundary.
Of the rivers flowing north into the Atlantic, the most important
are the Navia, which has its lower course through Oviedo; the
Eo, for some distance the boundary between the two provinces;
the Masma, the Oro and the Landrove.</p>

<p>Some of the valleys of Lugo are fertile, and yield not only corn
but fruit and wine. The principal agricultural wealth, however,
is on the Miño and Sil, where rye, maize, wheat, flax, hemp and
a little silk are produced. Agriculture is in a very backward
condition, mainly owing to the extreme division of land that
prevails throughout Galicia. The exportation of cattle to Great
Britain, formerly a flourishing trade, was ruined by American
and Australian competition. Iron is found at Caurel and Incio,
arsenic at Castroverde and Cervantes, argentiferous lead at
Riotorto; but, although small quantities of iron and arsenic
are exported from Rivadéo, frequent strikes and lack of transport
greatly impeded the development of mining in the earlier years of
the 20th century. There are also quarries of granite, marble and
various kinds of slate and building-stone. The only important
manufacturing industries are those connected with leather,
preserves, coarse woollen and linen stuffs, timber and osier work.
About 250 coasting vessels are registered at the ports, and about
as many boats constitute the fishing fleet, which brings in
lampreys, soles, tunny and sardines, the last two being salted
and tinned for export. The means of communication are
insufficient, though there are over 100 m. of first-class roads,
and the railways from Madrid and northern Portugal to Corunna
run through the province.</p>

<p>Lugo the capital (pop. 1900, 26,959) and the important towns of
Chantada (15,003), Fonsagrada (17,302), Mondoñedo (10,590),
Monforte (12,912), Panton (12,988), Villalba (13,572) and Vivero
(12,843) are described in separate articles. The province contained
in 1900 twenty-six towns of more than 7000 inhabitants, the
largest being Sarria (11,998) and Saviñao (11,182). For a general

<p><span class="bold">LUGO,<a name="ar222" id="ar222"></a></span> capital of the above Spanish province, is situated on
the left bank of the river Miño and on the railway from Corunna
to Madrid. Pop. (1900) 26,959. Lugo is an episcopal see, and was
formerly the capital of Galicia. Suburbs have grown up round
the original town, the form of which, nearly quadrangular, is
defined by a massive Roman wall 30 to 40 ft. high and 20 ft.
thick, with projecting semi-circular towers which numbered 85
as late as 1809, when parts of the fortifications were destroyed
by the French. The wall now serves as a promenade. The
Gothic cathedral, on the south side of the town, dates from the
12th century, but was modernized in the 18th, and possesses
no special architectural merit. The conventual church of Santo
Domingo dates from the 14th century. The principal industries
are tanning, and the manufacture of linen and woollen cloth.
About 1 m. S., on the left bank of the Miño, are the famous hot
sulphur baths of Lugo.</p>

<p>Lugo (<i>Lucus Augusti</i>) was a flourishing city under Roman rule
(<i>c.</i> 19 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 409) and was made by Augustus the seat of a
<i>conventus juridicus</i> (assize). Its sulphur baths were even then
well known. It was sacked by barbarian invaders in the 5th
century, and suffered greatly in the Moorish wars of the 8th
century. The bishopric dates from a very early period, and it
<span class="correction" title="amended from it">is</span> said to have acquired metropolitan rank in the middle of the
6th century; it is now in the archiepiscopal province of Santiago
de Compostela.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUGOS,<a name="ar223" id="ar223"></a></span> the capital of the county of Krassó-Szörény, Hungary,
225 m. S.E. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900) 16,126. It is
situated on both banks of the river Temes, which divides the
town in two quarters, the Rumanian on the right and the German
on the left bank. It is the seat of a Greek-United (Rumanian)
bishop. Lugos carries on an active trade in wine, and has several
important fairs, while the surrounding country, which is mountainous
and well-wooded, produces large quantities of grapes
and plums. Lugos was once a strongly fortified place and of
greater relative importance than at present. It was the last
seat of the Hungarian revolutionary government (August 1849),
and the last resort of Kossuth and several other leaders of the
national cause, previous to their escape to Turkey.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUGUDUNUM,<a name="ar224" id="ar224"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lugdunum</span>, an old Celtic place-name (fort
or hill of the god Lugos or Lug) used by the Romans for several
towns in ancient Gaul. The most important was the town at
the confluence of the Saône and Rhone now called Lyons (<i>q.v.</i>).
This place had in Roman times two elements. One was a Roman
<i>colonia</i> (municipality of Roman citizens, self-governing) situated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
on the hill near the present Fourviéres (<i>Forum vetus</i>). The other,
territorially distinct from it for reasons of statecraft, was the
Temple of Roma and Augustus, to which the inhabitants of the
64 Gallic cantons in the three Roman provinces of Aquitania,
Lugudunensis and Belgica&mdash;the so-called Tres Galliae&mdash;sent
delegates every summer to hold games and otherwise celebrate
the worship of the emperor which was supposed to knit the
provincials to Rome. The two elements together composed the
most important town of western Europe in Roman times.
Lugudunum controlled the trade of its two rivers, and that which
passed from northern Gaul to the Mediterranean or vice versa;
it had a mint; it was the capital of all northern Gaul, despite its
position in the south, and its wealth was such that, when Rome
was burnt in Nero&rsquo;s reign, its inhabitants subscribed largely to
the relief of the Eternal City.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUINI, BERNARDINO<a name="ar225" id="ar225"></a></span> (?1465-?1540), the most celebrated
master of the Lombard school of painting founded upon the
style of Leonardo da Vinci, was born at Luino, a village on Lago
Maggiore. He wrote his name as &ldquo;Bernardin Lovino,&rdquo; but the
spelling &ldquo;Luini&rdquo; is now generally adopted. Few facts are known
regarding his life, and until a comparatively recent date many
even of his works had, in the lapse of years and laxity of attribution,
got assigned to Leonardo da Vinci. It appears that Luini
studied painting at Vercelli under Giovenone, or perhaps under
Stephano Scotto. He reached Milan either after the departure
of Da Vinci in 1500, or shortly before that event; it is thus
uncertain whether or not the two artists had any personal
acquaintance, but Luini was at any rate in the painting-school
established in Milan by the great Florentine. In the later
works of Luini a certain influence from the style of Raphael is
superadded to that, far more prominent and fundamental, from
the style of Leonardo; but there is nothing to show that he ever
visited Rome. His two sons are the only pupils who have with
confidence been assigned to him; and even this can scarcely be
true of the younger, who was born in 1530, when Bernardino
was well advanced in years. Guadenzio Ferrari has also been
termed his disciple. One of the sons, Evangelista, has left little
which can now be identified; the other, Aurelio, was accomplished
in perspective and landscape work. There was likewise a
brother of Bernardino, named Ambrogio, a competent painter.
Bernardino, who hardly ever left Lombardy, had some merit as a
poet, and is said to have composed a treatise on painting. The
precise date of his death is unknown; he may perhaps have
survived till about 1540. A serene, contented and happy mind,
naturally expressing itself in forms of grace and beauty, seems
stamped upon all the works of Luini. The same character is
traceable in his portrait, painted in an upper group in his fresco of
&ldquo;Christ crowned with Thorns&rdquo; in the Ambrosian library in Milan&mdash;a
venerable bearded personage. The only anecdote which has
been preserved of him tells a similar tale. It is said that for the
single figures of saints in the church at Saronno he received a
sum equal to 22 francs per day, along with wine, bread and
lodging; and he was so well satisfied with this remuneration that,
in completing the commission, he painted a Nativity for nothing.</p>

<p>A dignified suavity is the most marked characteristic of
Luini&rsquo;s works. They are constantly beautiful, with a beauty
which depends at least as much upon the loving self-withdrawn
expression as upon the mere refinement and attractiveness of
form. This quality of expression appears in all Luini&rsquo;s productions,
whether secular or sacred, and imbues the latter with
a peculiarly religious grace&mdash;not ecclesiastical unction, but the
devoutness of the heart. His heads, while extremely like those
painted by Leonardo, have less subtlety and involution and less
variety of expression, but fully as much amenity. He began
indeed with a somewhat dry style, as in the &ldquo;Pietà&rdquo; in the
church of the Passione; but this soon developed into the quality
which distinguishes all his most renowned works; although his
execution, especially as regards modelling, was never absolutely
equal to that of Leonardo. Luini&rsquo;s paintings do not exhibit an
impetuous style of execution, and certainly not a negligent one;
yet it appears that he was in fact a very rapid worker, as his
picture of the &ldquo;Crowning with Thorns,&rdquo; painted for the College
del S. Sepolcro, and containing a large number of figures, is
recorded to have occupied him only thirty-eight days, to which
an assistant added eleven. His method was simple and expeditious,
the shadows being painted with the pure colour laid on
thick, while the lights are of the same colour thinly used, and
mixed with a little white. The frescoes exhibit more freedom
of hand than the oil pictures; and they are on the whole less like
the work of Da Vinci, having at an early date a certain resemblance
to the style of Mantegna, as later on to that of Raphael.
Luini&rsquo;s colouring is mostly rich, and his light and shade forcible.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among his principal works the following are to be mentioned.
At Saronno are frescoes painted towards 1525, representing the life
of the Madonna&mdash;her &ldquo;Marriage,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Presentation of the Infant
Saviour in the Temple,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Adoration of the Magi&rdquo; and other
incidents. His own portrait appears in the subject of the youthful
&ldquo;Jesus with the Doctors in the Temple.&rdquo; This series&mdash;in which some
comparatively archaic details occur, such as gilded nimbuses&mdash;was
partly repeated from one which Luini had executed towards 1520
in S. Croce. In the Brera Gallery, Milan, are frescoes from the
suppressed church of La Pace and the Convent della Pelucca&mdash;the
former treating subjects from the life of the Virgin, the latter, of
a classic kind, more decorative in manner. The subject of girls
playing at the game of &ldquo;hot-cockles,&rdquo; and that of three angels
depositing St Catherine in her sepulchre, are particularly memorable,
each of them a work of perfect charm and grace in its way. In the
Casa Silva, Milan, are frescoes from Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>. The
Monastero Maggiore of Milan (or church of S. Maurizio) is a noble
treasure-house of Luini&rsquo;s art&mdash;including a large Crucifixion, with
about one hundred and forty figures; &ldquo;Christ bound to the
Column,&rdquo; between figures of Saints Catherine and Stephen, and
the founder of the chapel kneeling before Catherine; the martyrdom
of this saint; the &ldquo;Entombment of Christ,&rdquo; and a large
number of other subjects. In the Ambrosian library is the fresco
(already mentioned), covering one entire wall of the Sala della S.
Corona, of &ldquo;Christ crowned with Thorns,&rdquo; with two executioners,
and on each side six members of a confraternity; in the same building
the &ldquo;Infant Baptist playing with a Lamb&rdquo;; in the Brera, the
&ldquo;Virgin Enthroned, with Saints&rdquo; (dated 1521); in the Louvre, the
&ldquo;Daughter of Herodias receiving the Head of the Baptist&rdquo;; in the
Esterhazy Gallery, Vienna, the &ldquo;Virgin between Saints Catherine
and Barbara&rdquo;; in the National Gallery, London, &ldquo;Christ disputing
with the Doctors&rdquo; (or rather, perhaps, the Pharisees). Many or
most of these gallery pictures used to pass for the handiwork of Da
Vinci. The same is the case with the highly celebrated &ldquo;Vanity and
Modesty&rdquo; in the Sciarra Palace, Rome, which also may nevertheless
in all probability be assigned to Luini. Another singularly beautiful
picture by him is in the Royal Palace in Milan&mdash;a large composition
of &ldquo;Women Bathing.&rdquo; That Luini was also pre-eminent as a decorative
artist is shown by his works in the Certosa of Pavia.</p>

<p>A good account of Luini by Dr G. C. Williamson was published in
1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUKE,<a name="ar226" id="ar226"></a></span> the traditional author of the third Gospel and of the
Book of Acts, and the most literary among the writers of the
New Testament. He alone, too, was of non-Jewish origin
(Col. iv. 11, 14), a fact of great interest in relation to his writings.
His name, a more familiar form of Lucanus (cf. Silas for Silvanus,
Acts xvii. 4, 1 Thess. i. 1, and see <i>Encycl. Bibl.</i> s.v., for instances
of <span class="grk" title="Doukas">&#916;&#959;&#965;&#954;&#8118;&#962;</span> on Egyptian inscriptions), taken together with his
profession of physician (Col. iv. 14), suggests that he was son of
a Greek freedman possibly connected with Lucania in south
Italy; and as Julius Caesar gave Roman citizenship to all
physicians in Rome (Sueton. <i>Jul.</i> 42), Luke may even have
inherited this status from his father. But in any case such a man
would have the attitude to things Roman which appears in the
works attributed to Luke. He was a fellow-worker of Paul&rsquo;s
when in Rome (Philemon 24), where he seems to have remained
in constant attendance on his leader, as physician as well as
attached friend (Col. iv. 14; 2 Tim. iv. 11). That Luke, before
he became a Christian, was an adherent of the synagogue&mdash;not
a full proselyte, but one of those &ldquo;worshippers&rdquo; of God to
whom Acts makes frequent reference&mdash;is fairly certain from the
familiarity with the Septuagint indicated in Acts, as well as from
its sympathy with the Hellenistic type of piety as distinct from
specific Paulinism, of which there is but little trace.</p>

<p>The earliest extra-biblical reference to him is perhaps in the
Muratonian Canon, which implies that his name already stood in
MSS. of both Gospel (probably so even in Marcion&rsquo;s day) and
Acts, and says that Paul took him for his companion <i>quasi ut
juris studiosum</i> (&ldquo;as being a student of law&rdquo;). Here <i>juris</i> is
almost certainly corrupt; and whether we take the sense to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
been &ldquo;as being devoted to travel&rdquo; (<i>ut juris</i> = <i>itineris</i>) or &ldquo;as
skilled in disease&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="nosou">&#957;&#972;&#963;&#959;&#965;</span> passing into <span class="grk" title="nomou">&#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#965;</span> in the Greek
original), it is probably a mere inference from biblical data.
Beyond references in Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria (cf.
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hebrews</a></span>) and Tertullian, which add nothing to our knowledge,
we have the belief to which Origen (<i>Hom.</i> i. <i>in Lucam</i>) witnesses
as existing in his day, that Luke was the &ldquo;brother&rdquo; of 2 Cor. viii.
18, &ldquo;whose praise in the Gospel&rdquo; (as preached) was &ldquo;throughout
all the churches.&rdquo; Though the basis of the identification be a
mistake, yet that this &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; &ldquo;who was also appointed by
the churches (note the generality of this) to travel with us in the
matter of the charity,&rdquo; was none other than Paul&rsquo;s constant
companion Luke is quite likely; <i>e.g.</i> he seems to have been
almost the only non-Macedonian (as demanded by 2 Cor. ix. 2-4)
of Paul&rsquo;s circle available<a name="fa1ad" id="fa1ad" href="#ft1ad"><span class="sp">1</span></a> at the time (see Acts xx. 4). Our
next witness, a prologue to the Lucan writings (originally in
Greek, now known only in Latin, see <i>Nov. Test. Latine</i> (Oxford),
I. iii., II. i.), perhaps preserves a genuine tradition in stating
that Luke died in Bithynia at the age of seventy-four. It is
hard to see why this should be fiction, which usually took the
form of martyrdom, as in a later tradition touching his end.
The same prologue, and indeed all early tradition, connects him
originally with Antioch (see Euseb. <i>Hist. Eccl.</i> iii. 4, 6, possibly
after Julius Africanus in the first half of the 3rd century).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>That he was actually a native of Antioch is as doubtful as the
statement that he was a Syrian by race (Prologue). But internal
evidence bears out the view that he practised his profession in
Antioch, where (or in Tarsus) he probably first met Paul. Whether
any of his information in Acts as to the Gospel in Antioch (xi. 19 ff.,
xiii. 1 ff., xiv. 26-xv. 35) was due to an Antiochene document used
by him (cf. A. Harnack, <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>, 245 ff.) or not,
this knowledge in any case suggests Luke&rsquo;s connexion with that
church. He shows, too, local knowledge on points unlikely to have
stood in any such source (<i>e.g.</i> it was in Antioch that the name
&ldquo;Christians&rdquo; was first coined, xi. 26), which points to his share in
early Church life there. The Bezan reading in Acts xi. 27, &ldquo;when
<i>we</i> were assembled,&rdquo; may imply memory of this.</p>

<p>But while Luke probably met Paul in Antioch, and thence started
with him on his second great missionary enterprise (xv. 36 ff.), partly
at least as his medical attendant (cf. Gal. iv. 13), it is possible that
he had also some special connexion with the north-eastern part of
the Aegean. Sir W. M. Ramsay and others fancy that Luke&rsquo;s
original home was Philippi, and that in fact he may have been the
&ldquo;certain Macedonian&rdquo; seen in vision by Paul at Troas, inviting
help for his countrymen (xvi. 9 f.). But this is as precarious as the
view that, because &ldquo;we&rdquo; ceases at Philippi in xvi. 17, and then reemerges
in xx. 6, Luke must have resided there during all the interval.
The use and disuse of the first person plural, identifying Paul and
his party, has probably a more subtle and psychological<a name="fa2ad" id="fa2ad" href="#ft2ad"><span class="sp">2</span></a> meaning
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Acts</a></span>). The local connexion in question may have been subsequent
to that with Antioch, dating from his work with Paul in the
province of Asia, and being resumed after Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom. This
accords at once with Harnack&rsquo;s argument that Luke wrote Acts
in Asia<a name="fa3ad" id="fa3ad" href="#ft3ad"><span class="sp">3</span></a> (<i>Luke the Physician</i>, p. 149 ff.), and with the early tradition,
above cited, that he died in Bithynia at the age of seventy-four,
without ever having married (this touch may be due to an ascetic
feeling current already in the 2nd century).</p>

<p>The later traditions about Luke&rsquo;s life are based on fanciful inference
or misunderstanding, <i>e.g.</i> that he was one of the Seventy (Adamantius
<i>Dial. de recta fide</i>, 4th century), or the story (in Theodorus Lector,
6th century) that he painted a portrait of the Virgin Mother. But
a good deal can still be gathered by sympathetic study of his writings
as to the manner of man he was. It was a beautiful soul from which
came &ldquo;the most beautiful book&rdquo; ever written, as Renan styled
his Gospel. The selection of stories which he gives us&mdash;especially
in the section mainly peculiar to himself (ix. 51-xviii. 14)&mdash;reflects
his own character as well as that of the source he mainly follows.
His was indeed a <i>religio medici</i> in its pity for frail and suffering
humanity, and in its sympathy with the triumph of the Divine
&ldquo;healing art&rdquo; upon the bodies and souls of men (cf. Harnack, <i>The
Acts</i>, <i>Excursus</i>, iii.). His was also a humane<a name="fa4ad" id="fa4ad" href="#ft4ad"><span class="sp">4</span></a> spirit, a spirit so
tender that it saw further than almost any save the Master himself
into the soul of womanhood. In this, as in his joyousness, united
with a feeling for the poor and suffering, he was an early Francis
of Assisi. Luke, &ldquo;the physician, the beloved physician,&rdquo; that was
Paul&rsquo;s characterization of him; and it is the impression which his
writings have left on humanity. How great his contribution to
Christianity has been, in virtue of what he alone preserved of the
historical Jesus and of the embodiment of his Gospel in his earliest
followers, who can measure? Harnack even maintains (<i>The Acts</i>,
p. 301) that his story of the Apostolic age was the indispensable
condition for the incorporation of the Pauline epistles in the Church&rsquo;s
canon of New Testament scriptures. Certainly his conception of
the Gospel, viz. a Christian Hellenistic universalism (with some slight
infusion of Pauline thought) passed through a Graeco-Roman mind,
proved more easy of assimilation, and so more directly influential
for the ancient Church, than Paul&rsquo;s own distinctive teaching (ib.
281 ff.; cf. <i>Luke the Physician</i>, pp. 139-145).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUKE, GOSPEL OF ST,<a name="ar227" id="ar227"></a></span> the third of the four canonical
Gospels of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>1. <i>Authorship and Date.</i>&mdash;The earliest indication which we
possess of the belief that the author was Luke, the companion
of the Apostle Paul (Col. iv. 14; Philem. 24; 2 Tim. iv. 11),
is found in Justin Martyr, who, in his <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>
(<i>c.</i> 103), when making a statement found only in our Luke, instead
of referring for it simply to the &ldquo;Apostolic Memoirs,&rdquo; his
usual formula, says that it is contained in the memoirs composed
by &ldquo;the Apostles and <i>those that followed them</i>.&rdquo; But the first
distinct mention of Luke as the author of the Gospel is that by
Irenaeus in his famous passage about the Four Gospels (<i>Adv.
Haer.</i> III. i. 2, <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 180).</p>

<p>This tradition is important in spite of the fact that it first
comes clearly before us in a writer belonging to the latter part
of the 2nd century, because the prominence and fame of Luke
were not such as would of themselves have led to his being singled
out to have a Gospel attributed to him. The question of the
authorship cannot, however, be decided without considering the
internal evidence, the interpretation of which in the case of the
Third Gospel and the Acts (the other writing attributed to Luke)
is a matter of peculiar interest. It is generally admitted that
the same person is the author of both works in their present
form. This is intimated at the beginning of the second of them
(Acts i. 1); and both are marked, broadly speaking throughout,
though in some parts much more strongly than in others, by
stylistic characteristics which we may conveniently call &ldquo;Lucan&rdquo;
without making a premature assumption as to the authorship.
The writer is more versed than any other New Testament writer
except the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and very much
more than most of them, in the literary Greek of the period of
the rise of Christianity; and he has, also, like other writers,
his favourite words, turns of expression and thoughts. The
variations in the degree to which these appear in different
passages are in the main to be accounted for by his having before
him in many cases documents or oral reports, which he reproduces
with only slight alterations in the language, while at other
times he is writing freely.</p>

<p>We have next to observe that there are four sections in Acts
(xvi. 9-17, xx. 4-16, xxi. 1-17, xxvii. 1-xxviii. 16) in which
the first person plural is used. Now it is again generally admitted
that in these sections we have the genuine account of one who
was a member of Paul&rsquo;s company, who may well have been Luke.
But it has been and is still held by many critics that the author
of Acts is a different person, and that as in the Third Gospel he has
used documents for the Life of Christ, and perhaps also in the
earlier half of the Acts for the history of the beginnings of the
Christian Church, so in the &ldquo;we&rdquo; sections, and possibly in some
other portions of this narrative of Paul&rsquo;s missionary life, he has
used a kind of travel-diary by one who accompanied the Apostle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
on some of his journeys. That neither this, nor any other, companion
of Paul can have been the author of the whole work is
supposed to follow both from its theological temper and from
discrepancies between its statements and those of the Pauline
Epistles on matters of fact.</p>

<p>A careful examination, however, of the &ldquo;we&rdquo; sections shows
that words and expressions characteristic of the author of the
third Gospel and the Acts are found in them to an extent which
is very remarkable, and that in many instances they belong to
the very texture of the passages. This linguistic evidence, which
is of quite unusual force, has never yet been fairly faced by those
who deny Luke&rsquo;s authorship of Acts. Moreover, the difficulties
in the way of supposing that the author of Acts could at an
earlier period of his life have been a companion of St Paul do not
seem to be so serious as some critics think. Indeed it is easier to
explain some of the differences between the Acts and St Paul&rsquo;s
Epistles on this assumption than on that of authorship by a
writer who would have felt more dependent upon the information
which might be gathered from those Epistles, and who would have
been more likely to have had a collection of them at hand, if his
work was composed <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 100, as is commonly assumed by
critics who reject the authorship by Luke.</p>

<p>There is then strong reason for believing the tradition that
Luke, the companion of the Apostle Paul, was the author of our
third Gospel and the Acts. Another argument in support of this
belief, upon which much reliance has been placed, is found in the
descriptions of diseases, and the words common in Greek medical
writers, contained in these two works. These, it is said, point to
the author&rsquo;s having been a physician, as Luke (Col. iv. 14) was
(see esp. Hobart, <i>The Medical Language of St Luke</i>, 1882). The
instances alleged are, many of them at least, not very distinctive.
Yet they have some value as confirming the conclusion based on
a comparison of the &ldquo;we&rdquo; sections of the Acts, with the remainder
of the two books.</p>

<p>If we may assume that the writer who uses the first person
plural in Acts xvi. 10 sqq. was the author of the two works, they
can hardly have been composed later than <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 96; he would
then have been about 65 years old, even if he was a very young
man when he first joined the Apostle. An earlier date than
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 96 cannot be assigned if it is held that his writings show
acquaintance with the <i>Antiquities of the Jewish People</i> by
Josephus. The grounds for supposing this appear, however, to
be wholly insufficient (see article on Acts by Bishop Lightfoot in
2nd ed. of Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dict. of Bible</i>, p. 39) and it is not easy to see
why he should have deferred writing so long. On the other hand,
a comparison of Luke xxi. 20-24 with Mark xiii. 14 seq. seems to
show that in using his document Luke here mingled with the
prophecy the interpretation which events had suggested and
that the siege of Jerusalem in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70 and dispersion of its inhabitants
had already taken place some little time before. <i>Circa</i>
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 80 may with probability be given as the time of the composition
of his Gospel.</p>

<p>2. <i>Contents, Sources and Arrangement.</i>&mdash;In the preface to his
Gospel, i. 1-4, Luke alludes to other Gospel-records which preceded
his own. He does not say whether he made any use of them,
but he seems to imply that his own was more complete. And this
was true in regard to the two which, from a comparison of his
Gospel with the other two Synoptics, we know that he did use.
These we may call his Marcan and his Logian document. Luke
also claims that he has written &ldquo;in order.&rdquo; The instances in
which he has departed from the Marcan order, and the manner in
which he has introduced his additional matter into the Marcan
outline, do not suggest the idea that he had any independent
knowledge of an exact kind of the chronological sequence of
events. By the phrase &ldquo;in order&rdquo; he may himself have intended
chiefly to contrast the orderliness and consecutiveness of his
account with the necessarily fragmentary character of the catechetical
instruction which Theophilus had received. He may,
also, have had in view the fact that he has prefixed a narrative of
the birth and infancy of Jesus and of John and so begun the
history at what he considered to be its true point of departure;
to this he plainly alludes when he says that he has &ldquo;traced the
course of all things accurately from the first.&rdquo; He may, also,
in part be thinking of those indications which he&mdash;and he alone
among the evangelists&mdash;has given of the points in the course of
secular history at which Jesus was born and the Baptist began to
preach (ii. 1-3, iii. 1, 2), though it may be doubted whether
these are in all respects accurate.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Chap. i. 5-ii. 52. <i>The Birth and Infancy of John and of Jesus.</i>&mdash;This
portion of the Gospel differs in style and character from all the
remainder. Its source may be an Aramaic or a Hebrew document.
Some critics, however, hold that it is wholly Luke&rsquo;s own composition,
and that the Hebraic style&mdash;in which he was able to write in consequence
of his familiarity with the LXX.&mdash;has been adopted by him
as suitable to the subject in hand. Perhaps an intermediate view
may be the most probable one; he may have obtained part of his
materials, especially the hymns, from some source, and have skilfully
worked these into his narrative.</p>

<p>Chap. iii. 1-iv. 13. <i>From the Commencement of the Preaching of the
Baptist to the End of the Temptation in the Wilderness.</i>&mdash;The accounts
of the Baptist&rsquo;s preaching and of the temptation are taken from the
Logian document. The genealogy of Jesus here given is peculiar to
this Gospel.</p>

<p>Chap. iv. 14-vi. 16 <i>From the Commencement of the Ministry of
Jesus in Galilee to the Appointment of the Twelve.</i>&mdash;In the main Luke
here follows his Marcan document. He has, however, independent
narratives of the visit of Jesus to Nazareth (iv. 16-30) and the call
of the first disciples (v. 1-11). The former, which in Mark is placed
some way on in the Galilean ministry (vi. 1-6<i>a</i>), is given by Luke
at the very beginning of it, perhaps because of the previous connexion
of Jesus with Nazareth. But that it is not in its right position
here, before any mention of the work in Capernaum, appears from
verse 23. Luke has also slightly altered the position of the call of
the first disciples in the sequence of events.</p>

<p>Chap. vi. 17-viii. 3.&mdash;This is an insertion into the Marcan outline
of matter chiefly taken from the Logian document (the Address,
Luke vi. 20-49, corresponds with portions of the Sermon on the
Mount in Matt, v.-vii.;  the healing of the centurion&rsquo;s servant,
Luke vii. 1-10 = Matt. viii. 5-13; the message of the Baptist and the
discourse for which it gave occasion, Luke vii. 18-35 = Matt. xi. 2-19).
He includes besides, a few pieces peculiar to this Gospel which Luke
had probably himself collected.</p>

<p>Chap. viii. 4-ix. 50. <i>From the Adoption of Parabolic Teaching to the
End of the Ministry in Galilee.</i>&mdash;He begins again to follow his Marcan
document for what he gives. Many sections, however, contained in
the corresponding part of Mark have no parallel in Luke, while the
parallel to one of them is placed later and differs considerably in form.
Possibly this fact points to his Marcan document having been briefer
than our Mark, and to its having afterwards received interpolations
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mark, Gospel of St</a></span>).</p>

<p>Chap. ix. 51-xviii. 14. <i>Incidents and Teaching connected with
Journey towards Jerusalem.</i>&mdash;This is another insertion into the Marcan
outline, much longer than the previous one, and consisting partly of
matter taken from the Logian document (warnings to men who offer
to become disciples, Luke ix. 57-60 = Matt. viii. 19-22; a mission-charge,
Luke x. 2-16 = Matt. ix. 37 and x. 7-16, 40; thanksgiving
that the Father reveals to the simple that which is hidden from the
wise, Luke x. 21-24 = Matt. xi. 25-27 and xiii. 16, 17, &amp;c., &amp;c.) and
partly of sections peculiar to Luke, about which the same remark
may be made as before.</p>

<p>Chap. xviii. 15-xxii. 13. <i>From the Bringing of young Children to
Jesus to the Preparation for the Passover.</i>&mdash;Luke again takes up his
Marcan document, nearly at the point at which he left it, and follows
it in the main, though he adds the story of Zacchaeus and the parable
of the Minae (the Ten Pieces of Money), and omits the withering of
the fig-tree and some matter at the end of the discourse on the Last
Things, which are given in Mark.</p>

<p>Chap. xxii. 14 to end. <i>The Last Supper, Passion and Resurrection.</i>&mdash;
Though in this portion of his Gospel signs of use of Mark are not
wanting, he also has much that is peculiar to himself. It is supposed
by some that he here made use of another document. It seems more
likely that he had a good many distinct oral traditions for this part
of the history and that he used them freely, sometimes substituting
them for passages of the Marcan document, sometimes altering the
latter in accordance therewith.</p>
</div>

<p>3. <i>Doctrinal, Ethical and Literary Characteristics.</i>&mdash;The thought
of divine forgiveness, as set forth in the teaching of Jesus and
manifested in His own attitude towards, and power over, the
hearts of the outcasts among the people, is peculiarly prominent
in this Gospel. This feature of Christ&rsquo;s ministry appears only
in one passage of Mark; some other illustrations of it are
mentioned in Matthew, but in Luke there are several more
which are peculiar to himself (see the three individual cases
vii. 36 sqq.; xix. 1 sqq., xxiii. 40 sqq.; also the description at xv. 1,
and the three parables that follow). These were &ldquo;lost sheep of
the house of Israel&rdquo;; but Christ&rsquo;s freedom from Jewish exclusiveness
is also brought out (1) as regards Samaritans, by the rebuke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
administered to the disciples at ix. 52 sqq., the parable in x. 30 sqq.,
and the incident at xvii. 15-19; whereas they are not mentioned
in Mark, and in Matthew only in the saying (x. 5) in which the
Twelve are forbidden to enter any village of theirs; (2) as regards
Gentiles, by the words of Jesus at iv. 25-27, not to mention sayings
which have parallels in the other Gospels. The promises of Old
Testament prophets that the Gentiles would share in the blessing
of the coming of Christ are also recalled, ii. 32-iii. 6. Once more the
word <span class="grk" title="euangelizesthai">&#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span> (&ldquo;to proclaim good tidings&rdquo;) is a favourite
one with Luke. These are all traits which we should expect to find
in one who was a companion of Paul and a Gentile (Col. iv. 11, 14).</p>

<p>With the breadth and depth of the Saviour&rsquo;s sympathy, which
are so fully exhibited in this Gospel, we may connect the clearness
with which His true humanity is here portrayed. An incident
of His boyhood is related in which His sense of vocation is
revealed, and this is followed by the years of quiet growth that
succeeded (ii. 41-52). Further, during the years of His public
ministry more glimpses of His inner life are given us than in either
Matthew or Mark. His being engaged in prayer is mentioned
several times where there is no parallel in those Gospels (iii. 21,
v. 16, vi. 12, ix. 18, 28, 29, xi. 1). Again, besides narrating
the Temptation in the Wilderness and the Agony in the Garden,
this evangelist gives a saying which implies that Jesus had undergone
many temptations, or rather a life of temptation (xxii. 28).
Once more he records a saying that shows Christ&rsquo;s sense of the
intense painfulness of the work He was sent into the world to do,
arising from the divisions which it caused (xii. 49 sqq.).</p>

<p>Among practical duties, the stress laid on that of almsgiving is
remarkable (see especially xi. 41, xii. 33, xvi. 9 sqq., which are
peculiar to this Gospel). In the second of these passages the
disciples are exhorted to choose a life of voluntary poverty; the
nearest parallel is the ideal set before the rich young man at
Mark x. 21 = Matt. xix. 21 = Luke xviii. 22. In the Beatitudes in
Luke vi. 20, 21 a condition of physical want is contemplated, not,
as in Matt. v. 3, 6, poverty of spirit and spiritual hunger, while woes
are denounced against the rich and the full (vi. 24, 25). The folly
of absorption in the amassing and enjoyment of wealth is also
shown (xii. 15 sqq. and xvi. 19 sqq.). But it would be an exaggeration
to say, as some have done, that the poor are represented as
being the heirs of a blessed hereafter, simply on the ground that
they are now poor. In the Beatitudes Christ&rsquo;s own disciples are
addressed, who were blessed <i>though</i> poor, whereas the rich as a
class were opposed or indifferent to the kingdom of God. Again,
the contrast between Lazarus and Dives in the future state
pictures vividly the reversals that are in store; but it is unreasonable
to take it as implying that every poor man, whatever
his moral character, will be blessed.</p>

<p>But while there is in Luke&rsquo;s Gospel this strain of asceticism&mdash;as
to many in modern times it will appear to be&mdash;the prevailing
spirit is gentle and tender, and there is in it a note of spiritual
gladness, which is begun by the song and the messages of angels
and the hymns and rejoicing of holy men and women, accompanying
the birth of the Christ (chaps. i. and ii., <i>passim</i>), and
prolonged by the expressions of joy, the ascriptions of thanksgiving
and praise, called forth by the words and works of Christ
and the wonders of the cross and resurrection, which are peculiarly
frequent and full (iv. 15, v. 25, 26, vii. 16, x. 17, xiii. 13, 17,
xvii. 15-18, xviii. 43, xix. 6, 37, 38, xxiii. 47, xxiv. 41, 52, 53.
Cf. also xv. 5, 7, 10, 32).</p>

<p>The peculiar charm which this Gospel has been generally
felt to possess is largely due to the spiritual and ethical traits
which have been noted. But from a purely literary point of view,
also, it is distinguished by great excellences. The evangelist&rsquo;s
phraseology is indeed affected to some extent by the rhetorical
style of the period when he wrote. Nevertheless his mode of
narration is simple and direct. And the many fascinating
character-sketches, which he has added to the portrait gallery
of Scripture, are drawn clearly and without signs of effort.
In some cases he has skilfully suggested parallelisms and contrasts.
The chief instance is his careful interweaving of the
accounts of the births and early years of John the Baptist and
of Jesus. Later examples are the two sisters, Martha and Mary
(x. 38-42), and the penitent and the impenitent thief (xxiii.
39-48). That he was a man of great versatility appears in the
Acts from the speeches introduced on various occasions, if (as
is probable) they were in part, at least, his own composition.
In the Gospel he had no opportunity for showing his power in a
manner strictly analogous. But if the hymns in the two introductory
chapters owe even their Greek form in any measure to
him, he was a poet of no mean order. His style varies greatly;
at times, as in i. 1-4, it is Hellenistic; at others, as in i. 5 to end
of ii., it is strongly Hebraic. Such differences are largely due,
no doubt, to the degree in which he was in various parts independent
of, or dependent upon, sources. But he would seem in
some degree to have adapted his manner of writing to the subject-matter
in hand. And at all events it is worthy of note that we
pass without any sense of jar from passages in one style to those
in another.</p>

Catalan author, mystic and missionary, was born at Palma
(Majorca). Inheriting the estate conferred upon his father for
services rendered during the victorious expedition (1229) against
the Balearic Islands, Lull was married at an early age to
Bianca Picany, and, according to his own account, led a
dissipated life till 1266 when, on five different occasions, he
beheld the vision of Christ crucified. After his conversion,
he resolved to devote himself to evangelical work among the
heathen, to write an exposure of infidel errors, and to promote
the teaching of foreign tongues in seminaries. He dedicated
nine years to the study of Arabic, and in 1275 showed such signs
of mental exaltation that, at the request of his wife and family,
an official was appointed to administer his estate. He withdrew
to Randa, there wrote his <i>Ars major</i> and <i>Ars generalis</i>, visited
Montpellier, and persuaded the king of Majorca to build a
Franciscan monastery at Miramar. There for ten years he acted
as professor of Arabic and philosophy, and composed many
controversial treatises. After a fruitless visit to Rome in 1285-1286,
he journeyed to Paris, residing in that city from 1287 to
1289, and expounding his bewildering theories to auditors who
regarded him as half insane. In 1289 he went to Montpellier,
wrote his <i>Ars veritatis inventiva</i>, and removed to Genoa where
he translated this treatise into Arabic. In 1291, after many
timorous doubts and hesitations for which he bitterly blamed
himself, Lull sailed for Tunis where he publicly preached Christianity
for a year; he was finally imprisoned and expelled. In
January 1293 he reached Naples where tradition alleges that he
studied alchemy; there appears to be no foundation for this
story, and the treatises on alchemy which bear his name are all

a certain measure of success. He was, however, disappointed
in his main object, and in 1300 he sailed to Cyprus to seek support
for his plan of teaching Oriental languages in universities and
monasteries. He was rebuffed once more, but continued his
campaign with undiminished energy. Between 1302 and 1305
he wrote treatises at Genoa, lectured at Paris, visited Lyons
in the vain hope of enlisting the sympathies of Pope Clement
V., crossed over to Bougie in Africa, preached the gospel, and
was imprisoned there for six months. On being released he
lectured with increasing effect at Paris, attended the General
Council at Vienne in 1311, and there witnessed the nominal
adoption of his cherished proposals. Though close on eighty years
of age, Lull&rsquo;s ardour was unabated. He carried on his propaganda
at Majorca, Paris, Montpellier and Messina, and in 1314 crossed
over once more to Bougie. Here he resumed his crusade against
Mahommedanism, raised the fanatical spirit of the inhabitants,
was stoned outside the city walls and died of his wounds on the
29th of June 1315. There can be no reasonable doubt that these
events actually occurred, but the scene is laid by one biographer
at Tunis instead of Bougie.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The circumstances of Lull&rsquo;s death caused him to be regarded as a
martyr, local patriotism helped to magnify his merits, and his fantastic
doctrines found many enthusiastic partisans. The <i>doctor
illuminatus</i> was venerated throughout Catalonia and afterwards
throughout Spain, as a saint, a thinker and a poet; but his doctrines
were disapproved by the powerful Dominican order, and in 1376
they were formally condemned in a papal bull issued at the instance
of the inquisitor, Nicolas Emeric. The authenticity of this document
was warmly disputed by Lull&rsquo;s followers, and the bull was
annulled by Martin V. in 1417. The controversy was renewed in
1503 and again in 1578; but the general support of the Jesuits and
the staunch fidelity of the Majorcans saved Lull from condemnation.
His philosophical treatises abound with incoherent formulae to
which, according to their inventor, every demonstration in every
science may be reduced, and posterity has ratified Bacon&rsquo;s disdainful
verdict on Lull&rsquo;s pretensions as a thinker; still the fact that he
broke away from the scholastic system has recommended him to the
historians of philosophy, and the subtle ingenuity of his dialectic
has compelled the admiration of men so far apart in opinion as
Giordano Bruno and Leibniz.</p>

<p>The speculations of Lull are now obsolete outside Majorca where
his philosophy still flourishes, but his more purely literary writings
are extremely curious and interesting. In <i>Blanquerna</i> (1283), a
novel which describes a new Utopia, Lull renews the Platonic
tradition and anticipates the methods of Sir Thomas More, Campanella
and Harrington, and in the <i>Libre de Maravelles</i> (1286) he adopts
the Oriental apologue from <i>Kalilah and Dimnah</i>. And as a poet
Lull takes a prominent position in the history of Catalan literature;
such pieces as <i>El Desconort</i> (1295) and <i>Lo Cant de Ramon</i> (1299)
combine in a rare degree simple beauty of expression with sublimity
of thought and impassioned sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LULLY, JEAN-BAPTISTE<a name="ar231" id="ar231"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1633-1687), Italian composer,
was born in Florence. Through the duc de Guise he entered
the services of Madame de Montpensier as scullery-boy, and
with the help of this lady his musical talents were cultivated.
A scurrilous poem on his patroness resulted in his dismissal.
He then studied the theory of music under Métra and entered
the orchestra of the French court, being subsequently appointed
director of music to Louis XIV. and director of the Paris opera.
The influence of his music produced a radical revolution in the
style of the dances of the court itself. Instead of the slow and
stately movements which had prevailed until then, he introduced
lively ballets of rapid rhythm. In December 1661 he was
naturalized as a Frenchman, his original name being Giovanni
Battista Lulli. In 1662 he was appointed music master to the
royal family. In 1681 he was made a court secretary to the king
and ennobled. While directing a <i>Te Deum</i> on the 8th of January
1687 with a rather long baton he injured his foot so seriously
that a cancerous growth resulted which caused his death on the
22nd of March. Having found a congenial poet in Quinault,
Lully composed twenty operas, which met with a most enthusiastic
reception. Indeed he has good claim to be considered the
founder of French opera, forsaking the Italian method of separate
recitative and aria for a dramatic consolidation of the two and a
quickened action of the story such as was more congenial to the
taste of the French public. He effected important improvements
in the composition of the orchestra, into which he introduced
several new instruments. Lully enjoyed the friendship of
Molière, for some of whose best plays he composed illustrative
music. His <i>Miserere</i>, written for the funeral of the minister
Sequier, is a work of genius; and very remarkable are also his
minor sacred compositions. On his death-bed he wrote <i>Bisogna
morire, peccatore</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUMBAGO,<a name="ar232" id="ar232"></a></span> a term in medicine applied to a painful aliment
affecting the muscles of the lower part of the back, generally
regarded as of rheumatic origin. An attack of lumbago may
occur alone, or be associated with rheumatism in other parts of
the body. It usually comes on by a seizure, often sudden,
of pain in one or both sides of the small of the back, of a severe
cutting or stabbing character, greatly aggravated on movement
of the body, especially in attempting to rise from the recumbent
posture and also in the acts of drawing a deep breath, coughing
or sneezing. So intense is the suffering that it is apt to suggest
the existence of inflammation in some of the neighbouring
internal organs, such as the kidneys, bowels, &amp;c., but the absence
of the symptoms specially characteristic of these latter complaints,
or of any great constitutional disturbance beyond the pain,
renders the diagnosis a matter of no great difficulty. Lumbago
seems to be brought on by exposure to cold and damp, and by the
other exciting causes of rheumatism. Sometimes it follows
a strain of the muscles of the loins. The attack is in general
of short duration, but occasionally it continues for a long time,
as a feeling of soreness and stiffness on movement. The treatment
includes that for rheumatic affections in general (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rheumatism</a></span>)
and the application of local remedies to allay the pain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUMBER,<a name="ar233" id="ar233"></a></span> a word now meaning (1) useless discarded furniture
or other rubbish, particularly if of a bulky or heavy character;
(2) timber, when roughly sawn or cut into logs or beams (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Timber</a></span>); (3) as a verb, to make a loud rumbling noise, to move
in a clumsy heavy way, also to burden with useless material,
to encumber. &ldquo;Lumber&rdquo; and &ldquo;lumber-house&rdquo; were formerly
used for a pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop, being in this sense a variant of
&ldquo;Lombard,&rdquo; a name familiar throughout Europe for a banker,
money-changer or pawnbroker. This has frequently been taken
to be the origin of the word in sense (1), the reference being to the
store of unredeemed and unsaleable articles accumulating in
pawnbrokers&rsquo; shops. Skeat adopts this in preference to the
connexion with &ldquo;lumber&rdquo; in sense (3), but thinks that the word
may have been influenced by both sources (<i>Etym. Dict.</i>, 1910).
This word is probably of Scandinavian origin, and is cognate
with a Swedish dialect word <i>lomra</i>, meaning &ldquo;to roar,&rdquo; a
frequentative of <i>ljumma</i>, &ldquo;to make a noise.&rdquo; The English word
may be of native origin and merely onomatopoeic. The <i>New
English Dictionary</i>, though admitting the probability of the
association with &ldquo;Lombard,&rdquo; prefers the second proposed
derivation. The application of the word to timber is of American
origin; the <i>New English Dictionary</i> quotes from <i>Suffolk</i> (Mass.)
<i>Deeds</i> of 1662&mdash;&ldquo;Freighted in Boston, with beames ... boards
... and other lumber.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUMBIN&#298;,<a name="ar234" id="ar234"></a></span> the name of the garden or grove in which Gotama,
the Buddha, was born. It is first mentioned in a very ancient
Pali ballad preserved in the <i>Sutta Nip&#257;ta</i> (verse 583). This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
is the <i>Song of Nalaka</i> (the Buddhist Simeon), and the words put
in the mouth of the angels who announce the birth to him are:
&ldquo;The Wisdom-child, that jewel so precious, that cannot be
matched, has been born at Lumbin&#299;, in the S&#257;kiya land, for weal
and for joy in the world of men.&rdquo; The commentaries on the
<i>J&#257;takas</i> (i. 52, 54), and on a parallel passage in the <i>Majjhima</i>
(<i>J.R.A.S.</i>, 1895, p. 767), tell us that the mother of the future
Buddha was on her way from Kapilavastu (Kapilavatthu),
the capital of the S&#257;kiyas, to her mother&rsquo;s home at Devadaha,
the capital of the adjoining tribe, the Koliyas, to be confined
there. Her pains came upon her on the way, and she turned
aside into this grove, which lay not far from Devadaha, and gave
birth there to her son. All later Buddhist accounts, whether
Pali or Sanskrit, repeat the same story.</p>

<p>A collection of legends about Asoka, included in the <i>Divy&#257;vad&#257;na</i>,
a work composed probably in the 1st or 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>,
tells us (pp. 389, 390) how Asoka, the Buddhist emperor, visited
the traditional site of this grove, under the guidance of Upagupta.
This must have been about 248 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Upagupta (Tissa: see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pali</a></span>) himself also mentions the site in his <i>Kath&#257; Vatthu</i> (p. 559).
The Chinese pilgrims, Fa Hien and Hsuan Tsang, visiting India
in the 5th and 7th centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, were shown the site; and the
latter (ed. Watters, ii. 15-19) mentions that he saw there an
Asoka pillar, with a horse on the top, which had been split,
when Hsuan Tsang saw it, by lightning. This pillar was rediscovered
under the following circumstances.</p>

<p>The existence, a few miles beyond the Nepalese frontier,
of an inscribed pillar had been known for some years when,
in 1895, the discovery of another inscribed pillar at Nigl&#299;va,
near by, led to the belief that this other, hitherto neglected,
one must also be an Asoka pillar, and very probably the one
mentioned by Hsuan Tsang. At the request of the Indian
government the Nepalese government had the pillar, which was
half-buried, excavated for examination; and Dr Führer, then
in the employ of the Archaeological Survey, arrived soon afterwards
at the spot.</p>

<p>The stone was split into two portions, apparently by lightning,
and was inscribed with Pali characters as used in the time of
Asoka. Squeezes of the inscription were sent to Europe, where
various scholars discussed the meaning, which is as follows:
&ldquo;His Majesty, Piyadassi, came here in the 21st year of his reign
and paid reverence. And on the ground that the Buddha,
the S&#257;kiya sage, was born here, he (the king) had a flawless
stone cut, and put up a pillar. And further, since the Exalted
One was born in it, he reduced taxation in the village of Lumbin&#299;,
and established the dues at one-eighth part (of the crop).&rdquo;</p>

<p>The inscription, having been buried for so many centuries
beneath the soil, is in perfect preservation. The letters, about
an inch in height, have been clearly and deeply cut in the stone.
No one of them is doubtful. But two words are new, and scholars
are not agreed in their interpretation of them. These are the
adjective <i>viga&#7693;abh&#299;</i> applied to the stone, and rendered in our
translation &ldquo;flawless&rdquo;; and secondly, the last word, rendered
in our translation &ldquo;one-eighth part (of the crop).&rdquo; Fortunately
these words are of minor importance for the historical value
of this priceless document. The date, the twenty-first year after
the formal coronation of Asoka, would be 248 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The name
Piyadassi is the official epithet always used by Asoka in his
inscriptions when speaking of himself. The inscription confirms
in every respect the Buddhist story, and makes it certain that,
at the time when it was put up, the tradition now handed down
in the books was current at the spot. Any further inference
that the birth really took place there is matter of probability
on which opinions will differ.</p>

<p>The grove is situate about 3 m. north of Bhagwanpur, the
chief town of a district of the same name in the extreme south
of Nepal, just over the frontier dividing Nepal from the district
of Basti in British territory. It is now called Rummin-dei, <i>i.e.</i>
the shrine of the goddess of Rummin, a name no doubt derived
from the ancient name Lumbin&#299;. There is a small shrine at
the spot, containing a bas-relief representing the birth of the
Buddha. But the Buddha is now forgotten there, and the bas-relief
is reverenced only for the figure of the mother, who has
been turned into a tutelary deity of the place. Except so far
as the excavation of the pillar is concerned the site has not been
explored, and four small stupas there (already noticed by
Hsuan Tsang) have not been opened.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUMP-SUCKER,<a name="ar235" id="ar235"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lump-Fish</span> (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>), a
marine fish, which with another British genus (<i>Liparis</i>) and a
few other genera forms a small family (Cyclopteridae). Like
many littoral fishes of other families, the lump-suckers have
the ventral fins united into a circular concave disk, which,
acting as a sucker, enables them to attach themselves firmly to
rocks or stones. The body (properly so called) is short and thick,
with a thick and scaleless skin, covered with rough tubercles,
the larger of which are arranged in four series along each side
of the body. The first dorsal fin is almost entirely concealed by
the skin, appearing merely as a lump on the back. The lump-sucker
inhabits the coasts of both sides of the North Atlantic;
it is not rare on the British coasts, but becomes more common
farther north. It is so sluggish in its habits that individuals
have been caught with sea-weed growing on their backs. In the
spring the fish approaches the shores to spawn, clearing out a
hollow on a stony bottom in which it deposits an immense
quantity of pink-coloured ova. Fishermen assert that the male
watches the spawn until the young are hatched, a statement
which receives confirmation from the fact that the allied gobies,
or at least some of them, take similar care of their progeny.
The vernacular name, &ldquo;cock and hen paddle,&rdquo; given to the lump-fish
on some parts of the coast, is probably expressive of the
difference between the two sexes in their outward appearance,
the male being only half or one-third the size of the female, and
assuming during the spawning season a bright blue coloration,
with red on the lower parts. This fish is generally not esteemed
as food, but Franz Faber (<i>Fische Islands</i>, p. 53) states that the
Icelanders consider the flesh of the male as a delicacy.<a name="fa1af" id="fa1af" href="#ft1af"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The
bones are so soft, and contain so little inorganic matter, that the
old ichthyologists placed the lump-sucker among the cartilaginous
fishes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUMSDEN, SIR HARRY BURNETT<a name="ar236" id="ar236"></a></span> (1821-1896), Anglo-Indian
soldier, son of Colonel Thomas Lumsden, C.B., was born
on the 12th of November 1821. He joined the 59th Bengal
Native Infantry in 1838, was present at the forcing of the Khyber
Pass in 1842, and went through the first and second Sikh wars,
being wounded at Sobraon. Having become assistant to Sir
Henry Lawrence at Lahore in 1846, he was appointed in 1847
to raise the Corps of Guides. The object of this corps, composed
of horse and foot, was to provide trustworthy men to act as
guides to troops in the field, and also to collect intelligence
beyond as well as within the North-West frontier of India. The
regiment was located at Mardan on the Peshawar border, and has
become one of the most famous in the Indian army. For the
equipment of this corps, Lumsden originated the <i>khaki</i> uniform.
In 1857 he was sent on a mission to Kandahar with his younger
brother, Sir Peter Lumsden, in connexion with the subsidy paid
by the Indian government to the amir, and was in Afghanistan
throughout the Mutiny. He took part in the Waziri Expedition
of 1860, was in command of the Hyderabad Contingent from
1862, and left India in 1869. He became lieutenant-general
in 1875, and died on the 12th of August 1896.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUNA, ÁLVARO DE<a name="ar237" id="ar237"></a></span> (d. 1453), Constable of Castile, Grand
Master of Santiago, and favourite of King John II. of Castile,
was the natural son of Álvaro de Luna, a Castilian noble. He was
introduced to the court as a page by his uncle Pedro de Luna,
archbishop of Toledo, in 1410. Álvaro soon secured a commanding
influence over John II., then a mere boy. During the regency
of the king&rsquo;s uncle Ferdinand, which ended in 1412, he was not
allowed to be more than a servant. When, however, Ferdinand
was elected king of Aragon, and the regency remained in the
hands of the king&rsquo;s mother, Constance, daughter of John of
Gaunt, a foolish and dissolute woman, Álvaro became a very
important person. The young king regarded him with an
affection which the superstition of the time attributed to witchcraft.
As the king was surrounded by greedy and unscrupulous
nobles, among whom his cousins, the sons of Ferdinand, commonly
known as the Infantes (princes) of Aragon, were perhaps
the worst, his reliance on a favourite who had every motive to
be loyal to him is quite intelligible. Álvaro too was a master of
all the accomplishments the king admired&mdash;a fine horseman,
a skilful lance and a writer of court verse. Until he lost the
king&rsquo;s protection he was the central figure of the Castilian history
of the time. It was a period of constant conflict conducted by
shifting coalitions of the nobles, who under pretence of freeing
the king from the undue influence of his favourite were intent on
making a puppet of him for their own ends. The part which
Álvaro de Luna played has been diversely judged. To Mariana
he appears as a mere self-seeking favourite. To others he has
seemed to be a loyal servant of the king who endeavoured to
enforce the authority of the crown, which in Castile was the only
alternative to anarchy. He fought for his own hand, but his
supremacy was certainly better than the rule of gangs of plundering
nobles. His story is in the main one of expulsions from the
court by victorious factions, and of his return when his conquerors
fell out among themselves. Thus in 1427 he was solemnly
expelled by a coalition of the nobles, only to be recalled in the
following year. In 1431 he endeavoured to employ the restless
nobles in a war for the conquest of Granada. Some successes
were gained, but a consistent policy was impossible with a rebellious
aristocracy and a king of indolent character. In 1445
the faction of the nobles allied with Álvaro&rsquo;s main enemies,
the Infantes de Aragon, were beaten at Olmedo, and the favourite,
who had been constable of Castile and count of Santestéban since
1423, became Grand Master of the military order of Santiago
by election of the Knights. His power appeared to be thoroughly
established. It was, however, based on the personal affection
of the king. The king&rsquo;s second wife, Isabella of Portugal, was
offended at the immense influence of the constable, and urged
her husband to free himself from slavery to his favourite. In
1453 the king succumbed, Álvaro was arrested, tried and condemned
by a process which was a mere parody of justice, and
executed at Valladolid on the 2nd of June 1453.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Chronicle of Álvaro de Luna</i> (Madrid, 1784), written by some
loyal follower who survived him, is a panegyric and largely a romance.
The other contemporary authority&mdash;the <i>Chronicle of John II.</i>&mdash;is
much less favourable to the constable. Don Jose Quintana has
summarized the two chronicles in his life of Luna in the <i>Vidas de
Españoles célebres; Biblioteca de Aulores Españoles</i> (Madrid,
1846-1880), vol. xix.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUNA<a name="ar238" id="ar238"></a></span> (mod. <i>Luni</i>), an ancient city of Etruria, Italy, 4½ m.
S.E. of the modern Sarzana. It was the frontier town of Etruria,
on the left bank of the river, Macra, the boundary in imperial
times between Etruria and Liguria. When the Romans first
appeared in these parts, however, the Ligurians were in possession
of the territory as far as Pisa. It derived its importance mainly
from its harbour, which was the gulf now known as the Gulf of
Spezia, and not merely the estuary of the Macra as some authors
have supposed. The town was apparently not established until
177 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when a colony was founded here, though the harbour
is mentioned by Ennius, who sailed hence for Sardinia in 205 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
under Manlius Torquatus. An inscription of 155 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, found
in the forum of Luna in 1857, was dedicated to M. Claudius
Marcellus in honour of his triumph over the Ligurians and
Apuani. It lost much of its importance under the Empire,
though traversed by the coast road (Via Aurelia), and it was
renowned for the marble from the neighbouring mountains of
Carrara, which bore the name of Luna marble. Pliny speaks of
the quarries as only recently discovered in his day. Good wine
was also produced. There are some remains of the Roman
period on the site, and a theatre and an amphitheatre may be
distinguished. No Etruscan remains have come to light.
O. Cuntz&rsquo;s investigations (<i>Jahreshefte des Österr. Arch. Instituts</i>,
1904, 46) seem to lead to the conclusion that an ancient road
crossed the Apennines from it, following the line of the modern

<p><span class="bold">LUNCHEON,<a name="ar241" id="ar241"></a></span> in present usage the name given to a meal between
breakfast and tea or dinner. When dinner was taken at
an early hour, or when it is still the principal midday meal,
luncheon was and is still a light repast. The derivation of the
word has been obscured, chiefly owing to the attempted connexion
with &ldquo;nuncheon,&rdquo; with which the word has nothing
to do etymologically. &ldquo;Luncheon&rdquo; is an extended form of
&ldquo;lunch&rdquo; (another form of &ldquo;lump,&rdquo; as &ldquo;hunch&rdquo; is of &ldquo;hump&rdquo;).
Lunch and luncheon in the earliest meanings found are applied
to a thick piece of bread, bacon, meat, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The word &ldquo;nuncheon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;nunchion,&rdquo; with which &ldquo;luncheon&rdquo;
has been frequently connected, appears as early as the 14th century
in the form <i>noneschenche</i>. This meant a refreshment or distribution,
properly of drink, but also accompanied with some small quantity
of meat, taken in the early afternoon. The word means literally
&ldquo;noon-drink,&rdquo; from none or noon, <i>i.e.</i> <i>nona hora</i>, the ninth hour,
originally 3 o&rsquo;clock <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, but later &ldquo;midday&rdquo;&mdash;the church office
of &ldquo;nones,&rdquo; and also the second meal of the day, having been
shifted back&mdash;and <i>schenchen</i>, to pour out; cf. German <i>schenken</i>,
which means to retail drink and to give, present. <i>Schenche</i> is the
same as &ldquo;shank,&rdquo; the shin-bone, and the sense development appears
to be shin-bone, pipe, hence tap for drawing liquor. See also Skeat,
<i>Etymological Dict. of English Language</i> (1910), s.v. &ldquo;nunchion.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUND, TROELS FREDERIK<a name="ar242" id="ar242"></a></span> (1840-&emsp;&emsp;), Danish historian,
was born in Copenhagen on the 5th of September 1840. He
entered the university of Copenhagen in 1858. About the age
of thirty he took a post which brought before his notice the
treasures of the archives of Denmark. His first important work,
<i>Historiske Skitser</i>, did not appear until 1876, but after that time
his activity was stupendous. In 1879 was published the first
volume of his <i>Danmarks og Norges Historie i Slutningen af det
xvi. Aarhundrede</i>, a history of daily life in Denmark and Norway
at the close of the 16th century. Troels Lund was the pioneer
of the remarkable generation of young historians who came
forward in northern Europe about 1880, and he remained the
most original and conspicuous of them. Saying very little about
kings, armies and governments, he concentrates his attention
on the life, death, employments, pleasures and prejudices of
the ordinary men and women of the age with which he deals,
using to illustrate his theme a vast body of documents previously
neglected by the official historian. Lund was appointed historiographer-royal
to the king of Denmark and comptroller of the
Order of the Dannebrog. There was probably no living man to
whom the destruction of the archives, when Christiansborg Castle
was accidentally burned in 1884, was so acute a matter of distress.
But his favourite and peculiar province, the MSS. of the 16th
century, was happily not involved in that calamity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUND,<a name="ar243" id="ar243"></a></span> a city of Sweden, the seat of a bishop, in the district
(<i>län</i>) of Malmöhus, 10 m. N.E. of Malmö by rail. Pop. (1900)
16,621. A university was founded here in 1668 by Charles XI.,
with faculties of law, medicine, theology and philosophy. The
number of students ranges from 600 to 800, and there are about
50 professors. Its library of books and MSS. is entitled to
receive a copy of every work printed in Sweden. Important
buildings include the university hall (1882), the academic union
of the students (1851) containing an art museum; the astronomical
observatory, built in 1866, though observations have been
carried on since 1760; the botanical museum, and ethnographical
and industrial art collections, illustrating life in southern Sweden
from early times. Each student belongs to one of twelve nations
(<i>landskap</i>), which mainly comprises students from a particular
part of the country. The Romanesque cathedral was founded
about the middle of the 10th century. The crypt under the
raised transept and choir is one of the largest in the world, and
the church is one of the finest in Scandinavia. A statue of the
poet Esaias Tegner stands in the Tegners Plads, and the house
in which he lived from 1813 to 1826 is indicated by an inscribed
stone slab. The chief industries are sugar-refining, iron and
brick works, and the manufacture of furniture and gloves.</p>

<p>Lund (<i>Londinum Gothorum</i>), the &ldquo;Lunda at Eyrarsund&rdquo; of
Egil&rsquo;s Saga, was of importance in Egil&rsquo;s time (<i>c.</i> 920). It appears
that, if not actually a seaport, it was at least nearer the Sound
than now. In the middle of the 11th century it was made a
bishopric, and in 1103 the seat of an archbishop who received
primatial rank over all Scandinavia in 1163, but in 1536 Lund
was reduced to a bishopric. Close to the town, at the hill of
Sliparabacke, the Danish kings used to receive the homage of the
princes of Skare, and a monument records a victory of Charles XI.
over the Danes (1676), which extinguished the Danish claim to
suzerainty over this district.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUNDY, BENJAMIN<a name="ar244" id="ar244"></a></span> (1789-1839), American philanthropist,
prominent in the anti-slavery conflict, was born of Quaker
parentage, at Hardwick, Warren county, New Jersey, on the
4th of January 1789. As a boy he worked on his father&rsquo;s farm,
attending school for only brief periods, and in 1808-1812 he lived
at Wheeling, Virginia (now W. Va.), where he served an apprenticeship
to a saddler, and where&mdash;Wheeling being an important
headquarters of the inter-State slave trade&mdash;he first became
deeply impressed with the iniquity of the institution of slavery,
and determined to devote his life to the cause of abolition. In
1815, while living at Saint Clairsville, Ohio, he organized an anti-slavery
association, known as the &ldquo;Union Humane Society,&rdquo; which
within a few months had a membership of more than five hundred
men. For a short time he assisted Charles Osborne in editing
the <i>Philanthropist</i>; in 1819 he went to St Louis, Missouri, and
there in 1810-1820 took an active part in the slavery controversy;
and in 1821 he founded at Mount Pleasant, Ohio, an anti-slavery
paper, the <i>Genius of Universal Emancipation</i>. This periodical,
first a monthly and later a weekly, was published successively
in Ohio, Tennessee, Maryland, the District of Columbia and
Pennsylvania, though it appeared irregularly, and at times, when
Lundy was away on lecturing tours, was issued from any office
that was accessible to him. From September 1829 until March
1830 Lundy was assisted in the editorship of the paper by
William Lloyd Garrison (<i>q.v.</i>). Besides travelling through many
states of the United States to deliver anti-slavery lectures,
Lundy visited Haiti twice&mdash;in 1825 and 1829, the Wilberforce
colony of freedmen and refugee slaves in Canada in 1830-1831,
and in 1832 and again in 1833 Texas, all these visits being made,
in part, to find a suitable place outside the United States to
which emancipated slaves might be sent. Between 1820 and
1830, according to a statement made by Lundy himself, he
travelled &ldquo;more than 5000 m. on foot and 20,000 in other ways,
visited nineteen states of the Union, and held more than 200
public meetings.&rdquo; He was bitterly denounced by slaveholders
and also by such non-slaveholders as disapproved of all anti-slavery
agitation, and in January 1827 he was assaulted and
seriously injured by a slave-trader, Austin Woolfolk, whom he
had severely criticized in his paper. In 1836-1838 Lundy edited
in Philadelphia a new anti-slavery weekly, <i>The National Enquirer</i>,
which he had founded, and which under the editorship of John
G. Whittier, Lundy&rsquo;s successor, became <i>The Pennsylvania
Freeman</i>. In 1838 Lundy removed to Lowell, La Salle county,
Illinois, where he printed several copies of the <i>Genius of Universal
Emancipation</i>. There, on the 22nd of August 1839, he died.
Lundy is said to have been the first to deliver anti-slavery
lectures in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUNDY, ROBERT<a name="ar245" id="ar245"></a></span> (fl. 1689), governor of Londonderry.
Nothing is known of Lundy&rsquo;s parentage or early life; but he
had seen service in the foreign wars before 1688, when he was
at Dublin with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the regiment
of Lord Mountjoy. When the apprentices of Derry closed the
gates in the face of the earl of Antrim, who was approaching
the city at the head of an Irish Catholic force in the interests
of James II., the viceroy Tyrconnel despatched Mountjoy to
pacify the Protestants. Mountjoy and his regiment were well
received in the north, and the citizens of Derry permitted him
to leave within their walls a small Protestant garrison under
the command of Lundy, who assumed the title of governor.
Popular feeling in Derry ran so strongly in favour of the prince
of Orange that Lundy quickly declared himself an adherent
of William; and he obtained from him a commission confirming
his appointment as governor. Whether Lundy was a deliberate
traitor to the cause he had embraced with explicit asseveration
of fidelity in a signed document, or whether, as Macaulay suggests,
he was only a cowardly poltroon, cannot certainly be
known. What is certain is that from the moment Londonderry
was menaced by the troops of King James, Lundy used all his
endeavours to paralyse the defence of the city. In April 1689
he was in command of a force of Protestants who encountered
some troops under Richard Hamilton at Strabane, when, instead
of holding his ground, he told his men that all was lost and
ordered them to shift for themselves; he himself was the first
to take flight back to Derry. King James, then at Omagh on
his way to the north, similarly turned in flight towards Dublin
on hearing of the skirmish, but returned next day on receiving
the true account of the occurrence. On the 14th of April English
ships appeared in the Foyle with reinforcements for Lundy
under Colonel Cunningham. Lundy dissuaded Cunningham
from landing his regiments, representing that a defence of
Londonderry was hopeless; and that he himself intended to
withdraw secretly from the city. At the same time he sent to
the enemy&rsquo;s headquarters a promise to surrender the city at
the first summons. As soon as this became known to the citizens
Lundy&rsquo;s life was in danger, and he was vehemently accused of
treachery. When the enemy appeared before the walls Lundy
gave orders that there should be no firing. But all authority
had passed out of his hands. The people flew to arms under
the direction of Major Henry Baker and Captain Adam Murray,
who organized the famous defence in conjunction with the
Rev. George Walker (<i>q.v.</i>). Lundy, to avoid popular vengeance,
hid himself until nightfall, when by the connivance of Walker
and Murray he made his escape in disguise. He was apprehended
in Scotland and sent to the Tower of London. He was
excluded from the Act of Indemnity in 1690, but his subsequent
fate is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUNDY,<a name="ar246" id="ar246"></a></span> an English island at the entrance of the Bristol
Channel, 12 m. N.W. by N. of the nearest point on the mainland,
namely Hartland Point on the Devonshire coast. The nearest
ports are Clovelly and Bideford. The extreme length of the island
is 3 m. from N. to S., the mean breadth about half a mile, but
at the south the breadth is nearly 1 m. The area is about 1150
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
acres. The component rock is a hard granite, except at the south,
where slate occurs. This granite was used in the construction
of the Victoria Embankment, London. An extreme elevation
of about 450 ft. is found in the southern half of the island; the
northern sloping gently to the sea, but the greater part of the
coast is cliff-bound and very beautiful. The landing, at the
south-east, is sheltered by the small Rat Island, where the once
common black rat survives. There are a few prehistoric remains
on Lundy, and the foundations of an ancient chapel of St Helen.
There are also ruins, and the still inhabited keep, of Marisco
Castle, occupying a strong precipitous site on the south-east,
held in the reign of Henry II. by Sir Jordan de Marisco. The
Mariscos, in their inaccessible retreat, lived lawlessly until in
1242 Sir William Marisco was hanged for instigating an attempt
on the life of Henry III. In 1625 the island was reported to be
captured by Turkish pirates, and in 1633 by Spaniards. Later
it became an object of attack and a hiding place for French
privateers. The island, which is reckoned as extra-parochial,
has some cultivable land and heath pasture, and had a population
in 1901 of 94.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÜNEBURG,<a name="ar247" id="ar247"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province
of Hanover, situated near the foot of a small hill named the
Kalkberg, on the navigable Ilmenau, 14 m. above its confluence
with the Elbe and 30 m. by rail S.E. of Hamburg by the main
line to Hanover. Pop. (1905) 26,751. Numerous handsome
medieval buildings testify to its former prosperity as a prominent
member of the Hanseatic league, and its many quaint houses
with high gables and overhanging eaves have gained for it the
appellation &ldquo;the Nüremberg of the North.&rdquo; Portions of the
old walls survive, but the greater part of the former circumvallation
has been converted into promenades and gardens,
outside which a modern town has sprung up. The finest of its
squares are the market-place and the so-called Sand. The
churches of St John, with five aisles and a spire 375 ft. in height;
of St Michael, containing the tombs of the former princes of
Lüneburg, and of St Nicolas, with a huge nave and a lofty
spire, are fine Gothic edifices of the 14th and 15th centuries.
The old town-hall in the market square is a huge pile, dating
originally from the 13th century, but with numerous additions.
It has an arcade with frescoes, restored by modern Munich
artists, and contains a magnificent hall&mdash;the Fürstensaal&mdash;richly
decorated with wood-carving and stained-glass windows.
Galvanoplastic casts of the famous Lüneburg silver plate, consisting
of 36 pieces which were acquired in 1874 by the Prussian
government for £33,000 and are now housed in the art museum
in Berlin, are exhibited here. Among other public edifices are
the old palace; the convent of St Michael (now converted into
a school and law court), and the Kaufhaus (merchants&rsquo; hall).
There are a museum, a library of 36,000 volumes, classical and
commercial schools, and a teachers&rsquo; seminary. Lüneburg owes
its importance chiefly to the gypsum and lime quarries of the
Kalkberg, which afford the materials for its cement works, and
to the productive salt-spring at its base which has been known
and used since the 10th century. Hence the ancient saying
which, grouping with these the commercial facilities afforded
by the bridge over the Ilmenau, ascribes the prosperity of Lüneburg
to its <i>mons, fons, pons</i>. Other industries are the making
of chemicals, ironware, soda and haircloth. There is a considerable
trade in French wines, for which Lüneburg has for
centuries been one of the chief emporia in north Germany, and
also in grain and wool. Celebrated are its lampreys, <i>Lüneburger
Bricken</i>.</p>

<p>Lüneburg existed in the days of Charlemagne, but it did not
gain importance until after the erection of a convent and a
castle on the Kalkberg in the 10th century. After the destruction
of Bardowiek, then the chief commercial centre of North
Germany, by Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, in 1189, Lüneburg
inherited much of its trade and subsequently became one
of the principal towns of the Hanseatic league. Having belonged
to the extensive duchy of Saxony it was the capital of the duchy
of Brunswick-Lüneburg from 1235 to 1369; later it belonged to
one or other of the branches of the family of Brunswick, being
involved in the quarrels, and giving its name to cadet lines,
of this house. From the junior line of Brunswick-Lüneburg
the reigning family of Great Britain is descended. The reformed
doctrines were introduced into the town in 1530 and
it suffered heavily during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. It reached
the height of its prosperity in the 15th century, and in the 17th
century it was the depot for much of the merchandise exported
from Saxony and Bavaria to the mouth of the Elbe; then after
a period of decay the 19th century witnessed a revival of its
prosperity. In 1813 the German war of liberation was begun
by an engagement with the French near Lüneburg.</p>

province of Hanover, lying between the Aller and the Elbe
and intersected by the railways Harburg-Hanover and Bremen-Stendal.
Its main character is that of a broad saddle-back,
running for 55 m. from S.E. to N.W. of a mean elevation of about
250 ft. and attaining its greatest height in the Wilseder Berg
(550 ft.) at its northern end. The soil is quartz sand and is
chiefly covered with heather and brushwood. In the north, and
in the deep valleys through which the streams descend to the
plain, there are extensive forests of oak, birch and beech, and
in the south, of fir and larch. Though the climate is raw and
good soil rare, the heath is not unfertile. Its main products
are sheep&mdash;the celebrated Heidschnucken breed,&mdash;potatoes,
bilberries, cranberries and honey. The district is also remarkable
for the numerous Hun barrows found scattered throughout its
whole extent.</p>

It is also used of a panel space of semi-circular shape, filled by

<p><span class="bold">LUNÉVILLE,<a name="ar250" id="ar250"></a></span> an industrial and garrison town of north-eastern
France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of
Meurthe-et-Moselle, 21 m. E.S.E. of Nancy on the railway to
Strassburg. Pop. (1906) town, 19,199; commune, 24,266
(including troops). The town stands on the right bank of the
Meurthe between that river and its affluent the Vezouze, a little
above their confluence. Its château, designed early in the 18th
century by the royal architect Germain Boffrand, was the
favourite residence of Duke Leopold of Lorraine, where he
gathered round him an academy composed of eminent men of
the district. It is now a cavalry barracks, and the gardens
form a public promenade. Lunéville is an important cavalry
station with a large riding school. The church of St Jacques
with its two domed towers dates from 1730-1745. There are
statues of General Count Antoine de Lasalle, and of the Conventional
Abbé Henri Grégoire. The town is the seat of a sub-prefect,
and has a tribunal of first instance and a communal college.
It carries on cotton-spinning and the manufacture of railway
material, motor vehicles, porcelain, toys, hosiery, embroidery,
straw-hats and gloves. Trade is in grain, wine, tobacco, hops
and other agricultural produce.</p>

<p>The name of Lunéville (<i>Lunae villa</i>) is perhaps derived from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
an ancient cult of Diana, the moon goddess, a sacred fountain
and medals with the effigy of this goddess having been found at
Leormont, some 2 m. E. of the town. Lunéville belonged to
Austrasia, and after various changes fell, in 1344, to the house
of Lorraine. A walled town in the middle ages, it suffered in
the Thirty Years&rsquo; War and in the campaigns of Louis XIV.
from war, plague and famine. The town flourished again under
Dukes Leopold and Stanislas, on the death of the latter of whom,
which took place at Lunéville, Lorraine was united to France
(1766). The treaty of Lunéville between France and Austria
(1801) confirmed the former power in the possession of the left
bank of the Rhine.</p>

lightness. The word &ldquo;lights&rdquo; was formerly used as synonymous
with &ldquo;lungs,&rdquo; but is now confined to the lungs of sheep, pigs
or cattle; it is etymologically connected with &ldquo;lung,&rdquo; the

<p><span class="sc">Surgery of the Lung and Pleura.</span>&mdash;When a person meets
with a severe injury to the chest, as from a wheel passing over him,
the ribs may be broken and driven into the lung. Air then entering
into the pleural space, the lung collapses, and breathing becomes so
difficult that death may ensue from asphyxia. Short of this, however,
there is a cough with the spitting of frothy, blood-stained mucus
or of bright red blood. All that can be done is to place the person
on his back, slightly propped up by pillows, and to combat syncope
by subcutaneous injections of ether and strychnia.</p>

<p><i>Empyema</i> means the presence of an abscess between the lung and
the chest wall, <i>i.e.</i> in the pleural space; it is the result of a septic
inflammation of the pleura by the micro-organisms of pneumonia
or of typhoid fever, or by some other germs. As the abscess increases
in size, the lung is pushed towards the spine, and that side of the
chest gives a dull note on percussion. If much fluid collects the
heart may be pushed out of its place, and, the lung-space being
taken up, respiration is embarrassed. Having made sure of the
presence of an abscess by exploring with syringe and hollow needle,
the surgeon opens and drains it. The drainage is made more effectual
by removing an inch or so of one of the ribs, for, unless this is done,
there is a risk of the rubber drainage tube being compressed as the
ribs come closer together again.</p>

<p>The lung itself has sometimes to be operated on, as when it is the
seat of an hydatid cyst, or when it contains an abscess cavity which
cannot otherwise be drained, or when it becomes necessary to remove
a foreign body the exact situation of which has been revealed by the
X-rays. Portions of some of the ribs having been resected, the
pleural cavity is opened, and if the lung has not already become glued
to the chest-wall by inflammatory adhesions, it is stitched up to the
chest-wall, and in a few days, when adhesions have taken place, an
incision is safely made into the lung-tissue. See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Respiratory

<p><span class="bold">LUNGE, GEORG<a name="ar254" id="ar254"></a></span> (1839-&emsp;&emsp;), German chemist, was born at
Breslau on the 15th of September 1839. He studied at Heidelberg
(under R. W. Bunsen) and Breslau, graduating at the
latter university in 1859. Turning his attention to technical
chemistry, he became chemist at several works both in Germany
and England, and in 1876 he was appointed professor of technical
chemistry at Zürich polytechnic. Lunge&rsquo;s original contributions
cover a very wide field, dealing both with technical processes
and analysis. In addition, he was a voluminous writer, enriching
scientific literature with many standard works. His treatises
<i>Coal Tar and Ammonia</i> (5th ed. 1909; 1st ed. 1867), <i>Destillation
des Steinkohlentheers</i> and <i>Sulphuric Acid and Alkali</i> (1st ed.
1878, 4th ed. 1909), established his position as the highest
authority on these subjects, while the <i>Chemische-technische
Untersuchungs-Methoden</i> (1899-1900; Eng. trans.), to which he
contributed, testified to his researches in technical analysis.
His jubilee was celebrated at Zürich on the 15th of September
1909.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUPERCALIA,<a name="ar255" id="ar255"></a></span> a very ancient, possibly pre-Roman, pastoral
festival in honour of Lupercus. Its rites were under the superintendence
of a corporation of priests called Luperci,<a name="fa1ag" id="fa1ag" href="#ft1ag"><span class="sp">1</span></a> whose
institution is attributed either to the Arcadian Evander, or to
Romulus and Remus. In front of the Porta Romana, on the
western side of the Palatine hill, close to the Ficus Ruminalis
and the Casa Romuli, was the cave of Lupercus; in it, according
to the legend, the she-wolf had suckled the twins, and the bronze
wolf, which is still preserved in the Capitol, was placed in it in
296 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> But the festival itself, which was held on February 15th,
contains no reference to the Romulus legend, which is probably
later in origin, though earlier than the grecizing Evander legend.
The festival began with the sacrifice by the Luperci (or the
flamen dialis) of goats and a dog; after which two of the Luperci
were led to the altar, their foreheads were touched with a bloody
knife, and the blood wiped off with wool dipped in milk; then
the ritual required that the two young men should laugh. The
smearing of the forehead with blood probably refers to human
sacrifice originally practised at the festival. The sacrificial
feast followed, after which the Luperci cut thongs from the skins
of the victims and ran in two bands round the walls of the old
Palatine city, the line of which was marked with stones, striking
the people who crowded near. A blow from the thong prevented
sterility in women. These thongs were called <i>februa</i>, the festival
Februatio, and the day <i>dies februatus</i> (<i>februare</i> = to purify);
hence the name of the month February, the last of the old Roman
year. The object of the festival was, by expiation and purification,
to secure the fruitfulness of the land, the increase of the
flocks and the prosperity of the whole people. The Lupercal
(cave of Lupercus), which had fallen into a state of decay, was
rebuilt by Augustus; the celebration of the festival had been
maintained, as we know from the famous occurrence of it in
44 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It survived until <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 494, when it was changed by
Gelasius into the feast of the Purification. Lupercus, in whose
honour the festival was held, is identified with Faunus or Inuus,
Evander (<span class="grk" title="Euandros">&#917;&#8020;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>), in the Greek legend being a translation of
Faunus (the &ldquo;kindly&rdquo;). The Luperci were divided into two
<i>collegia</i>, called Quinctiliani (or Quinctiales) and Fabiani, from
the gens Quinctilia (or Quinctia)<a name="fa2ag" id="fa2ag" href="#ft2ag"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and Fabia; at the head of each
of these colleges was a magister. In 44 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> a third college,
Luperci Julii, was instituted in honour of Julius Caesar, the first
magister of which was Mark Antony. In imperial times the
members were usually of equestrian standing.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUPINE<a name="ar256" id="ar256"></a></span> (<i>Lupinus</i>), in botany, a genus of about 100 species
of annual and perennial herbaceous plants of the tribe <i>Genisteae</i>,
of the order Leguminosae. Species with digitate leaves range
along the west side of America from British Columbia to northern
Chile, while a few occur in the Mediterranean regions. A few
others with entire leaves are found in Brazil and eastern North
America. The leaves are remarkable for &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; in three
different ways. From being in the form of a horizontal star
by day, the leaflets either fall and form a hollow cone with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
bases upwards (<i>L. pilosus</i>), or rise and the cone is inverted
(<i>L. luteus</i>), or else the shorter leaflets fall and the longer rise,
and so together form a vertical star as in many species; the
object in every case being to protect the surfaces of the leaflets
from radiation and consequent wetting with dew (Darwin,
<i>Movements of Plants</i>, p. 340). The flowers are of the usual
&ldquo;papilionaceous&rdquo; or pea-like form, blue, white, purple or
yellow, in long terminal spikes. The stamens are monadelphous
and bear dimorphic anthers. The species of which earliest
mention is made is probably <i>L. Termis</i>, which was cultivated
by the ancient Egyptians. It is wild in some parts of the
Mediterranean area and is extensively cultivated in Egypt.
Its seeds are eaten by the poor after being steeped in water to
remove their bitterness; the stems furnish fuel and charcoal
for gunpowder. The lupine of the ancient Greeks and Romans
was probably <i>L. albus</i>, which is still extensively cultivated
in Italy, Sicily and other Mediterranean countries for forage,
for ploughing in to enrich the land, and for its round flat seeds,
which form an article of food. Yellow lupine (<i>L. luteus</i>) and
blue lupine (<i>L. angustifolius</i>) are also cultivated on the European
continent as farm crops for green manuring.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lupines are easily cultivated in moderately good garden soil;
they include annuals which are among the most ornamental and
most easily grown of summer flowering plants (sow in open borders
in April and May), and perennials, which are grown from seed or
propagated by dividing strong plants in March and April. Many of
the forms in cultivation are hybrid. One of the best known of the
perennial species is <i>L. polyphyllus</i>, a western North American species.
It grows from 3 to 6 ft. high, and has numerous varieties, including
a charming white-flowered one. The tree lupine (<i>L. arboreus</i>) is a
Californian bush, 2 to 4 ft. high, with fragrant yellow flowers. It is
only hardy in the most favoured parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUPUS, PUBLIUS RUTILIUS,<a name="ar257" id="ar257"></a></span> Roman rhetorician, flourished
during the reign of Tiberius. He was the author of a treatise
on the figures of speech (<span class="grk" title="Schêmata lexeôs">&#931;&#967;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#955;&#941;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>), abridged from a
similar work by the rhetorician Gorgias (of Athens, not the
well-known sophist of Leontini), the tutor of Cicero&rsquo;s son.
In its present form it is incomplete, as is clearly shown by the
express testimony of Quintilian (<i>Instit.</i> ix. 2, 103, 106) that
Lupus also dealt with figures of sense, rhetorical figures (<span class="grk" title="Schêmata
dianoias">&#931;&#967;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>). The work is valuable chiefly as containing a number
of examples, well translated into Latin, from the lost works of
Greek rhetoricians. The author has been identified with the
Lupus mentioned in the Ovidian catalogue of poets (<i>Ex Ponto</i>,
iv. 16), and was perhaps the son of the Publius Rutilius Lupus,
who was a strong supporter of Pompey.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUPUS<a name="ar258" id="ar258"></a></span> (Lat. <i>lupus</i>, wolf), a disease characterized by the
formation in the skin or mucous membrane of small tubercles
or nodules consisting of cell growth which has an inclination
to retrograde change, leading to ulceration and destruction of
the tissues, and, if it heals, to the subsequent formation of
permanent white scars. <i>Lupus vulgaris</i> is most commonly
seen in early life, and occurs chiefly on the face, about the nose,
cheeks or ears. But it may also affect the body or limbs. It
first shows itself as small, slightly prominent, nodules covered
with thin crusts or scabs. These may be absorbed and removed
at one point whilst spreading at another. Their disappearance
is followed by a permanent white cicatrix. The disease may be
superficial, in which case both the ulceration and the resulting
scar are slight (<i>lupus non-exedens</i>); or the ulcerative process
may be deep and extensive, destroying a large portion of the
nose or cheek, and leaving much disfigurement (<i>lupus exedens</i>).
A milder form, <i>lupus erythematosus</i>, occurs on the nose and
adjacent portions of the cheeks in the form of red patches
covered with thin scales, underneath which are seen the widened
openings of the sebaceous ducts. With a longitudinal patch
on the nose and spreading symmetrical patches on each cheek
the appearance is usually that of a large butterfly. It is slow
in disappearing, but does not leave a scar. Lupus is more
frequently seen in women than in men; it is connected with a
tuberculous constitution. In the superficial variety the application
of soothing ointments when there is much redness, and
linear incisions, or scrapings with a sharp spoon, to destroy the
increased blood supply, are often serviceable. In the ordinary
form the local treatment is to remove the new tissue growth
by solid points of caustic thrust into the tubercles to break
them up, or by scraping with a sharp spoon. The light-treatment
has been successfully applied in recent years. As medicines,
cod-liver oil, iron and arsenic are useful.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUQM&#256;N,<a name="ar259" id="ar259"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lokman</span>, the name of two, if not of three (cf.
note to Terminal Essay in Sir Rd. Burton&rsquo;s translation of the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>), persons famous in Arabian tradition. The one
was of the family of &lsquo;&#256;d, and is said to have built the great dike
of M&#257;rib and to have received the gift of life as long as that of
seven vultures, each of which lived eighty years. The name of
the seventh vulture&mdash;Lubad&mdash;occurs in proverbial literature.
The name of the second Luqm&#257;n, called &ldquo;Luqm&#257;n the Sage,&rdquo;
occurs in the Koran (31, 11). Two accounts of him are current
in Arabian literature. According to Mas&lsquo;&#363;d&#299; (i. 110) he was a
Nubian freedman who lived in the time of David in the district
of Elah and Midian. According to some commentators on the
Koran (<i>e.g.</i>, Baid&#257;w&#299;) he was the son of B&#257;&lsquo;&#363;r&#257;, one of the sons
of Job&rsquo;s sister or maternal aunt. Derenbourg in his <i>Fables
de Loqmân le sage</i> (1850) identifies B&#257;&rsquo;&#363;r&#257; with Beoi, and believes
the name Luqm&#257;n to be a translation of <i>Balaam</i>. The grave
of <i>Luqm&#257;n</i> was shown on the east coast of the lake of Tiberias,
also in Yemen (cf. Y&#257;q&#363;t, vol. iii. p. 512).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The so-called <i>Fables of Luqm&#257;n</i> are known to have existed in the
13th century, but are not mentioned by any Arabian writer. They
were edited by Erpenius (Leiden, 1615) and have been reprinted
many times. For the relation of these to similar literature in other
lands, see J. Jacobs&rsquo;s edition of Caxton&rsquo;s <i>Fables of Aesop</i>, vol. i.
(London, 1889). The name of Luqm&#257;n also occurs in many old
verses, anecdotes and proverbs; cf. G. Freytag&rsquo;s <i>Arabum Proverbia</i>
(Bonn, 1838-1843) and such Arabian writers as Tabar&#299;, Mas&lsquo;&#363;d&#299;,
